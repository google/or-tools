## About OR-Tools

Google Optimization Tools (a.k.a., OR-Tools) is an open-source, fast and
portable software suite for solving combinatorial optimization problems.

The suite contains:

*   A constraint programming solver;
*   Two linear programming solvers;
*   Wrappers around commercial and other open source solvers, including mixed
    integer solvers;
*   Bin packing and knapsack algorithms;
*   Algorithms for the Traveling Salesman Problem and Vehicle Routing Problem;
*   Graph algorithms (shortest paths, min cost flow, max flow, linear sum
    assignment).

We wrote OR-Tools in C++, but also provide wrappers in Python, C# and
Java.

## Installation

This software suite has been tested under:

*   Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and up (64-bit);
*   Apple macOS Mojave with Xcode 9.x (64-bit);
*   Microsoft Windows with Visual Studio 2019 (64-bit).

OR-Tools currently builds with a Makefile, but also provides Bazel and CMake
support.
