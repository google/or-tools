    "A major three-day horse jumping competition is scheduled next winter in Geneva.\n",
    "The show features riders and horses from all over the world, competing in\n",
    "several different competitions throughout the show. Six months before the show,\n",
    "riders submit the entries (i.e., rider name, horse, competition) to the\n",
    "organizers. Riders can submit multiple entries, for example, to compete in the\n",
    "same competition with multiple horses, or to compete in several competitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are additional space limitations. For example, the venue has 100 stalls,\n",
    "4 arenas (where competitions can be scheduled), and 6 paddocks (where riders\n",
    "warm up before their turn). It is also ideal that paddocks are not overloaded by\n",
    "riders from multiple competitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The organizer's goal is find a schedule in which competitions don't overlap, and\n",
    "the times at which they happen are scattered throughout the day (and hopefully\n",
    "not that early in the morning). The starting times of the competitions should be\n",
    "at the hour or 30 minutes past the hour (e.g. 9:30, 10:00, 10:30, etc.).\n",
    "Competitions can only be scheduled while there is daylight, except for\n",
    "competitions scheduled in the Main Stage arena, which is covered and has proper\n",
