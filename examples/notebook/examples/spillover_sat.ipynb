    "Solves the problem of buying physical machines to meet VM demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Spillover problem is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "You have M types of physical machines and V types of Virtual Machines (VMs). You\n",
    "can use a physical machine of type m to get n_mv copies of VM v. Each physical\n",
    "machine m has a cost of c_m. Each VM has a demand of d_v. VMs are assigned to\n",
    "physical machines by the following rule. The demand for each VM type arrives\n",
    "equally spaced out over the interval [0, 1]. For each VM type, there is a\n",
    "priority order over the physical machine types that you must follow. When a\n",
    "demand arrives, if there are any machines of the highest priority type\n",
    "available, you use them first, then you move on to the second priority machine\n",
    "type, and so on. Each VM type has a list of compatible physical machine types,\n",
    "and when the list is exhausted, the remaining demand is not met. Your goal is\n",
    "to pick quantities of the physical machines to buy (minimizing cost) so that at\n",
    "least some target service level (e.g. 95%) of the total demand of all VM is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of machines bought of each type and the number of VMs demanded of\n",
    "each type is large enough that you can solve an approximate problem instead,\n",
    "where the number of machines purchased and the assignment of machines to VMs is\n",
    "fractional, if it is helpful to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is not particularly interesting in isolation, it is more interesting\n",
    "to embed this LP inside a larger optimization problem (e.g. consider a two stage\n",
    "problem where in stage one, you buy machines, then in stage two, you realize VM\n",
    "demand).\n",
    "\n",
    "The continuous approximation of this problem can be solved by LP (see the\n",
    "MathOpt python examples). Doing this, instead of using MIP, is nontrivial.\n",
    "Below, we show that continuous relaxation can be approximately solved by CP-SAT\n",
    "as well, despite not having continuous variables. If you were solving the\n",
    "problem in isolation, you should just use an LP solver, but if you were to add\n",
    "side constraints or embed this within a more complex model, using CP-SAT could\n",
    "be appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "If for each VM type, the physical machines that are most cost effective are the\n",
    "highest priority, AND the target service level is 100%, then the problem has a\n",
    "trivial optimal solution:\n",
    "  1. Rank the VMs by lowest cost to meet a unit of demand with the #1 preferred\n",
    "     machine type.\n",
    "  2. For each VM type in the order above, buy machines from #1 preferred machine\n",
    "     type, until either you have met all demand for the VM type.\n",
    "\n",

    "This example is motivated by the Cloudy problem, see go/fluid-model.\n",
