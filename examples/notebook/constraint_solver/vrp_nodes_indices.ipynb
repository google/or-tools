    "\n",
    "This script generate few markdown tables to better understand\n",
    "the relation between nodes and indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to notice:\n",
    "* Since we have two duplicates (node 5 and node 4) solver need 2 extra indices to have an unique index for each vehicle start/stop and locations.\n",
    "* Solver needs to \"create\" an index for a vehicle 1 start since solver need an unique start index per vehicle.\n",
    "* All end nodes are moved to the end of the index list aka [15, 16, 17, 18].\n",
    "* routing.Size() return the number of node which are not end nodes (here 15 aka [0-14])\n",
    "note: using the two properties above, we know that any index in range(routing.Size()) is not a vehicle end node.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Since end nodes are moved to the end, their respective \"empty\" node index are\n",
    "reused so all locations indices are \"shifted\"\n",
    "e.g. node 9 is mapped to index 6\n",
    "* Same for start nodes which are moved to \"empty\" space\n",
    "e.g. start node 7 mapped to index 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Takeaway:\n",
    "* Allways use routing.Start(), routing.End(), manager.IndexToNode() or manager.NodeToIndex().\n",
    "* Location node is not necessarily equal to its index.\n",
    "* To loop through ALL indices use manager.GetNumberOfIndices() (Python) or manager::num_indices() (C++)\n",
