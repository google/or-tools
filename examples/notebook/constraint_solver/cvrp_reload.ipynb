    "\n",
    "   This is a sample using the routing library python wrapper to solve a CVRP\n",
    "   problem while allowing multiple trips, i.e., vehicles can return to a depot\n",
    "   to reset their load (\"reload\").\n",
    "\n",
    "   A description of the CVRP problem can be found here:\n",
    "   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_routing_problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Distances are in meters.\n",
    "\n",
    "   In order to implement multiple trips, new nodes are introduced at the same\n",
    "   locations of the original depots. These additional nodes can be dropped\n",
    "   from the schedule at 0 cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The max_slack parameter associated to the capacity constraints of all nodes\n",
    "   can be set to be the maximum of the vehicles' capacities, rather than 0 like\n",
    "   in a traditional CVRP. Slack is required since before a solution is found,\n",
    "   it is not known how much capacity will be transferred at the new nodes. For\n",
    "   all the other (original) nodes, the slack is then re-set to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The above two considerations are implemented in `add_capacity_constraints()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Last, it is useful to set a large distance between the initial depot and the\n",
    "   new nodes introduced, to avoid schedules having spurious transits through\n",
    "   those new nodes unless it's necessary to reload. This consideration is taken\n",
    "   into account in `create_distance_evaluator()`.\n",
