    "  A post office requires a different number of full-time employees working\n",
    "  on different days of the week [summarized below]. Union rules state that\n",

    "  two days off. For example, an employee who works on Monday to Friday\n",
    "  must be off on Saturday and Sunday. The post office wants to meet its\n",
    "  daily requirements using only full-time employees. Minimize the number\n",
    "  of employees that must be hired.\n",
    "\n",
    "  To summarize the important information about the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Every full-time worker works for 5 consecutive days and takes 2 days off\n",
    "    * Day 1 (Monday): 17 workers needed\n",

    "    * Day 4 : 19 workers needed\n",
    "    * Day 5 : 14 workers needed\n",
    "    * Day 6 : 16 workers needed\n",
    "    * Day 7 (Sunday) : 11 workers needed\n",
