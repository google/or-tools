    "  Every year my extended family does a 'secret santa' gift exchange.\n",
    "  Each person draws another person at random and then gets a gift for\n",
    "  them. At first, none of my siblings were married, and so the draw was\n",
    "  completely random. Then, as people got married, we added the restriction\n",
    "  that spouses should not draw each others names. This restriction meant\n",
    "  that we moved from using slips of paper on a hat to using a simple\n",
    "  computer program to choose names. Then people began to complain when\n",
    "  they would get the same person two years in a row, so the program was\n",
    "  modified to keep some history and avoid giving anyone a name in their\n",
    "  recent history. This year, not everyone was participating, and so after\n",
    "  removing names, and limiting the number of exclusions to four per person,\n",
    "  I had data something like this:\n",
