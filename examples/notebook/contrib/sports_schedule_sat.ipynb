    "\"\"\"Sports scheduling problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to solve the problem of scheduling of team matches in a\n",
    "double round robin tournament.  Given a number of teams, we want\n",
    "each team to encounter all other teams, twice, once at home, and\n",
    "once away. Furthermore, you cannot meet the same team twice in the\n",
    "same half-season.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there are constraints on the sequence of home or aways:\n",
    " - You cannot have 3 consecutive homes or three consecutive aways.\n",
    " - A break is a sequence of two homes or two aways, the overall objective\n",
    "   of the optimization problem is to minimize the total number of breaks.\n",
    " - If team A meets team B, the reverse match cannot happen less that 6 weeks\n",
    "   after.\n",
