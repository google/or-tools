    "  '''\n",
    "  Specification:\n",
    "  Consider a four way traffic junction with eight traffic lights. Four of the\n",
    "  traffic\n",
    "  lights are for the vehicles and can be represented by the variables V1 to V4\n",
    "  with domains\n",
    "  {r,ry,g,y} (for red, red-yellow, green and yellow). The other four traffic\n",
    "  lights are\n",
    "  for the pedestrians and can be represented by the variables P1 to P4 with\n",
    "  domains {r,g}.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The constraints on these variables can be modelled by quaternary constraints\n",
    "  on\n",
    "  (Vi, Pi, Vj, Pj ) for 1<=i<=4, j=(1+i)mod 4 which allow just the tuples\n",
    "  {(r,r,g,g), (ry,r,y,r), (g,g,r,r), (y,r,ry,r)}.\n",
    "\n",
    "  It would be interesting to consider other types of junction (e.g. five roads\n",
    "  intersecting) as well as modelling the evolution over time of the traffic\n",
    "  light sequence.\n",
    "  ...\n",
    "\n",
    "  Results\n",
    "  Only 2^2 out of the 2^12 possible assignments are solutions.\n",

    "  (V1,P1,V2,P2,V3,P3,V4,P4) =\n",

    "   The problem has relative few constraints, but each is very tight. Local\n",
