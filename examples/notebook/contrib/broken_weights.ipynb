    "      into four pieces as the result of a fall. When the pieces were\n",
    "      subsequently weighed, it was found that the weight of each piece\n",
    "      was a whole number of pounds and that the four pieces could be\n",
    "      used to weigh every integral weight between 1 and 40 pounds. What\n",

    "\n",
    "  Note that since this was a 17th-century merchant, he of course used a\n",
    "  balance scale to weigh things. So, for example, he could use a 1-pound\n",
    "  weight and a 4-pound weight to weigh a 3-pound object, by placing the\n",
