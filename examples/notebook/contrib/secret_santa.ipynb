    "  all play a Secret Santa game around Christmas time. We draw names and\n",
    "  spend a week sneaking that person gifts and clues to our identity. On the\n",
    "  last night of the game, we get together, have dinner, share stories, and,\n",
    "  most importantly, try to guess who our Secret Santa was. It's a crazily\n",
    "  fun way to enjoy each other's company during the holidays.\n",
    "\n",
    "  To choose Santas, we use to draw names out of a hat. This system was\n",
    "  tedious, prone to many 'Wait, I got myself...' problems. This year, we\n",
    "  made a change to the rules that further complicated picking and we knew\n",
    "  the hat draw would not stand up to the challenge. Naturally, to solve\n",
    "  this problem, I scripted the process. Since that turned out to be more\n",

    "  Obviously, a person cannot be their own Secret Santa. In addition, my friends\n",
