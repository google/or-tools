    "  Honoring a long standing tradition started by my wife's dad, my friends\n",
    "  all play a Secret Santa game around Christmas time. We draw names and\n",
    "  spend a week sneaking that person gifts and clues to our identity. On the\n",
    "  last night of the game, we get together, have dinner, share stories, and,\n",
    "  most importantly, try to guess who our Secret Santa was. It's a crazily\n",
    "  fun way to enjoy each other's company during the holidays.\n",
    "\n",
    "  To choose Santas, we use to draw names out of a hat. This system was\n",
    "  tedious, prone to many 'Wait, I got myself...' problems. This year, we\n",
    "  made a change to the rules that further complicated picking and we knew\n",
    "  the hat draw would not stand up to the challenge. Naturally, to solve\n",
    "  this problem, I scripted the process. Since that turned out to be more\n",
    "  interesting than I had expected, I decided to share.\n",

    "  This weeks Ruby Quiz is to implement a Secret Santa selection script.\n",

    "  Your script will be fed a list of names on STDIN.\n",

    "  Your script should then choose a Secret Santa for every name in the list.\n",
    "  Obviously, a person cannot be their own Secret Santa. In addition, my friends\n",
    "  no longer allow people in the same family to be Santas for each other and your\n",
    "  script should take this into account.\n",
