    "  My friend Einav gave me this programming puzzle to work on. Given\n",
    "  this array of positive and negative numbers:\n",
    "  33   30  -10 -6  18   7  -11 -23   6\n",
    "  ...\n",
    "  -25   4  16  30  33 -23  -4   4 -23\n",
    "\n",
    "  You can flip the sign of entire rows and columns, as many of them\n",
    "  as you like. The goal is to make all the rows and columns sum to positive\n",
    "  numbers (or zero), and then to find the solution (there are more than one)\n",
    "  that has the smallest overall sum. So for example, for this array:\n",
    "  33  30 -10\n",
    "  -16  19   9\n",
    "  -17 -12 -14\n",
    "  You could flip the sign for the bottom row to get this array:\n",
    "  33  30 -10\n",
    "  -16  19   9\n",
    "  17  12  14\n",
    "  Now all the rows and columns have positive sums, and the overall total is\n",
    "  108.\n",
    "  But you could instead flip the second and third columns, and the second\n",
    "  row, to get this array:\n",
    "  33  -30  10\n",
    "  16   19    9\n",
    "  -17   12   14\n",
    "  All the rows and columns still total positive, and the overall sum is just\n",
    "  66. So this solution is better (I don't know if it's the best)\n",
    "  A pure brute force solution would have to try over 30 billion solutions.\n",
    "  I wrote code to solve this in J. I'll post that separately.\n",
