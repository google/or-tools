    "  Consider selecting workers to build a house. The construction of a\n",
    "  house can be divided into a number of tasks, each requiring a number of\n",
    "  skills (e.g., plumbing or masonry). A worker may or may not perform a\n",
    "  task, depending on skills. In addition, each worker can be hired for a\n",
    "  cost that also depends on his qualifications. The problem consists of\n",
    "  selecting a set of workers to perform all the tasks, while minimizing the\n",
    "  cost. This is known as a set-covering problem. The key idea in modeling\n",
    "  a set-covering problem as an integer program is to associate a 0/1\n",
    "  variable with each worker to represent whether the worker is hired.\n",
    "  To make sure that all the tasks are performed, it is sufficient to\n",
    "  choose at least one worker by task. This constraint can be expressed by a\n",
    "  simple linear inequality.\n",
