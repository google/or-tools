    "\n",
    "  From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futoshiki\n",
    "  '''\n",
    "  The puzzle is played on a square grid, such as 5 x 5. The objective\n",
    "  is to place the numbers 1 to 5 (or whatever the dimensions are)\n",
    "  such that each row, and column contains each of the digits 1 to 5.\n",
    "  Some digits may be given at the start. In addition, inequality\n",
    "  constraints are also initially specifed between some of the squares,\n",
    "  such that one must be higher or lower than its neighbour. These\n",
    "  constraints must be honoured as the grid is filled out.\n",
