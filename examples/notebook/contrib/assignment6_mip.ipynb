    "  In its most general form, the problem is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "  There are a number of agents and a number of tasks. Any agent can be\n",
    "  assigned to perform any task, incurring some cost that may vary\n",
    "  depending on the agent-task assignment. It is required to perform all\n",
