  Simple diet problem using MIP in Google CP Solver.

  Standard Operations Research example.


  Minimize the cost for the products:

  Food                                      (ounces)     (ounces) (ounces)
  Chocolate Cake (1 slice)       400           3            2      2
  Chocolate ice cream (1 scoop)  200           2            2      4
