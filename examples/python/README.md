# Python examples
The following examples showcase how to use OrTools.
These examples should work for any Python3.7+.

We recommend that all projects you create target `Python 3.9`,
as this allows you to keep up-to-date with the latest Python frameworks.

Wherever you have `ortools` package installed, be sure to import it from your python file.

# Execution
For running the examples you can use the the following command:
```shell
python3 -m pip install --upgrade --user ortools
python3 <example>.py
```
