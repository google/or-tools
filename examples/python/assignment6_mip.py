  Assignment problem using MIP in Google or-tools.

  From GLPK:s example assign.mod:
  '''
  The assignment problem is one of the fundamental combinatorial
  optimization problems.

  In its most general form, the problem is as follows:

  There are a number of agents and a number of tasks. Any agent can be
  assigned to perform any task, incurring some cost that may vary
  depending on the agent-task assignment. It is required to perform all
  tasks by assigning exactly one agent to each task in such a way that
  the total cost of the assignment is minimized.

  (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.)
