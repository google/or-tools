"""Magic sequence problem.

This models aims at building a sequence of numbers such that the number of
occurrences of i in this sequence is equal to the value of the ith number.
It uses an aggregated formulation of the count expression called
distribute().

Usage: python magic_sequence_distribute.py NUMBER
