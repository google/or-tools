  Simple coloring problem using MIP in Google CP Solver.

  Inspired by the GLPK:s model color.mod
  '''
  COLOR, Graph Coloring Problem

  Written in GNU MathProg by Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

  Given an undirected loopless graph G = (V, E), where V is a set of
  nodes, E <= V x V is a set of arcs, the Graph Coloring Problem is to
  find a mapping (coloring) F: V -> C, where C = {1, 2, ... } is a set
  of colors whose cardinality is as small as possible, such that
  F(i) != F(j) for every arc (i,j) in E, that is adjacent nodes must
  be assigned different colors.
