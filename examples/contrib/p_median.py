P-median problem in Google CP Solver.

Model and data from the OPL Manual, which describes the problem:
'''
The P-Median problem is a well known problem in Operations Research.
The problem can be stated very simply, like this: given a set of customers
with known amounts of demand, a set of candidate locations for warehouses,
and the distance between each pair of customer-warehouse, choose P
warehouses to open that minimize the demand-weighted distance of serving
all customers from those P warehouses.
'''

* Comet: http://hakank.org/comet/p_median.co
