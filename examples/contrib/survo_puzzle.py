Survo puzzle Google CP Solver.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survo_Puzzle
'''
Survo puzzle is a kind of logic puzzle presented (in April 2006) and studied
by Seppo Mustonen. The name of the puzzle is associated to Mustonen's
Survo system which is a general environment for statistical computing and
related areas.

In a Survo puzzle the task is to fill an m * n table by integers 1,2,...,m*n
so
that each of these numbers appears only once and their row and column sums are
equal to integers given on the bottom and the right side of the table.
Often some of the integers are given readily in the table in order to
guarantee uniqueness of the solution and/or for making the task easier.
