Simple diet problem in Google CP Solver.

Standard Operations Research example in Minizinc


Minimize the cost for the products:
Type of                        Calories   Chocolate    Sugar    Fat
Food                                      (ounces)     (ounces) (ounces)
Chocolate Cake (1 slice)       400           3            2      2
Chocolate ice cream (1 scoop)  200           2            2      4
Cola (1 bottle)                150           0            4      1
Pineapple cheesecake (1 piece) 500           0            4      5
