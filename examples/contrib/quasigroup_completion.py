See Carla P. Gomes and David Shmoys:
"Completing Quasigroups or Latin Squares: Structured Graph Coloring Problem"

http://www.maa.org/mathland/mathtrek_5_8_00.html
'''
  Using only the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, arrange four sets of these numbers
  into
  a four-by-four array so that no column or row contains the same two numbers.
  The result is known as a Latin square.
  ...
  The so-called quasigroup completion problem concerns a table that is
  correctly
  but only partially filled in. The question is whether the remaining blanks
  in
  the table can be filled in to obtain a complete Latin square (or a proper
  quasigroup multiplication table).
