Futoshiki problem in Google CP Solver.

From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futoshiki
'''
The puzzle is played on a square grid, such as 5 x 5. The objective
is to place the numbers 1 to 5 (or whatever the dimensions are)
such that each row, and column contains each of the digits 1 to 5.
Some digits may be given at the start. In addition, inequality
constraints are also initially specifed between some of the squares,
such that one must be higher or lower than its neighbour. These
constraints must be honoured as the grid is filled out.

This Google CP Solver model is inspired by the Minion/Tailor
example futoshiki.eprime.
