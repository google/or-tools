Olympic puzzle in Google CP Solver.

Benchmark for Prolog (BProlog)
'''
File   : olympic.pl
Author : Neng-Fa ZHOU
Date   : 1993

Purpose: solve a puzzle taken from Olympic Arithmetic Contest

Given ten variables with the following configuration:

               X7   X8   X9   X10

                  X4   X5   X6

                     X2   X3

                        X1

We already know that X1 is equal to 3 and want to assign each variable
with a different integer from {1,2,...,10} such that for any three
variables
                      Xi   Xj

                         Xk
the following constraint is satisfied:

                    |Xi-Xj| = Xk
