Safe cracking puzzle in Google CP Solver.

From the Oz Primer:
http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~henz/projects/puzzles/digits/index.html
'''
The code of Professor Smart's safe is a sequence of 9 distinct
nonzero digits C1 .. C9 such that the following equations and
inequations are satisfied:

      C4 - C6   =   C7
 C1 * C2 * C3   =   C8 + C9
 C2 + C3 + C6   <   C8
           C9   <   C8

 and

 C1 <> 1, C2 <> 2, ..., C9 <> 9

can you find the correct combination?
