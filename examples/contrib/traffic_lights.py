Traffic lights problem in Google CP Solver.

CSPLib problem 16
http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~ianm/CSPLib/prob/prob016/index.html
'''
Specification:
Consider a four way traffic junction with eight traffic lights. Four of the
traffic
lights are for the vehicles and can be represented by the variables V1 to V4
with domains
{r,ry,g,y} (for red, red-yellow, green and yellow). The other four traffic
lights are
for the pedestrians and can be represented by the variables P1 to P4 with
domains {r,g}.

The constraints on these variables can be modelled by quaternary constraints
on
(Vi, Pi, Vj, Pj ) for 1<=i<=4, j=(1+i)mod 4 which allow just the tuples
{(r,r,g,g), (ry,r,y,r), (g,g,r,r), (y,r,ry,r)}.

It would be interesting to consider other types of junction (e.g. five roads
intersecting) as well as modelling the evolution over time of the traffic
light sequence.
...

Results
Only 2^2 out of the 2^12 possible assignments are solutions.

(V1,P1,V2,P2,V3,P3,V4,P4) =
   {(r,r,g,g,r,r,g,g), (ry,r,y,r,ry,r,y,r), (g,g,r,r,g,g,r,r),
   (y,r,ry,r,y,r,ry,r)}
   [(1,1,3,3,1,1,3,3), ( 2,1,4,1, 2,1,4,1), (3,3,1,1,3,3,1,1), (4,1, 2,1,4,1,
   2,1)}

 The problem has relative few constraints, but each is very tight. Local
 propagation
appears to be rather ineffective on this problem.
