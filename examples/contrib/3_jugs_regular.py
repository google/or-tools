3 jugs problem using regular constraint in Google CP Solver.

A.k.a. water jugs problem.

Problem from Taha 'Introduction to Operations Research',
page 245f .

For more info about the problem, see:
http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ThreeJugProblem.html

This model use a regular constraint for handling the
transitions between the states. Instead of minimizing
the cost in a cost matrix (as shortest path problem),
we here call the model with increasing length of the
sequence array (x).

Compare with other models that use MIP/CP approach,
as a shortest path problem:
* Comet: http://www.hakank.org/comet/3_jugs.co
* Comet: http://www.hakank.org/comet/water_buckets1.co
* MiniZinc: http://www.hakank.org/minizinc/3_jugs.mzn
* MiniZinc: http://www.hakank.org/minizinc/3_jugs2.mzn
* SICStus: http://www.hakank.org/sicstus/3_jugs.pl
