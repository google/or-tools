Who killed agatha? (The Dreadsbury Mansion Murder Mystery) in Google CP
Solver.

This is a standard benchmark for theorem proving.

http://www.lsv.ens-cachan.fr/~goubault/H1.dist/H1.1/Doc/h1003.html
'''
Someone in Dreadsbury Mansion killed Aunt Agatha.
Agatha, the butler, and Charles live in Dreadsbury Mansion, and
are the only ones to live there. A killer always hates, and is no
richer than his victim. Charles hates noone that Agatha hates. Agatha
hates everybody except the butler. The butler hates everyone not richer
than Aunt Agatha. The butler hates everyone whom Agatha hates.
Noone hates everyone. Who killed Agatha?

Originally from F. J. Pelletier:
Seventy-five problems for testing automatic theorem provers.
Journal of Automated Reasoning, 2: 216, 1986.

Note1: Since Google CP Solver/Pythons (currently) don't have
       special support for logical operations on decision
       variables (i.e. ->, <->, and, or, etc), this model
       use some IP modeling tricks.

Note2: There are 8 different solutions, all stating that Agatha
       killed herself
