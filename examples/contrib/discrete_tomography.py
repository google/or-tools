 Discrete tomography in Google CP Solver.

 Problem from http://eclipse.crosscoreop.com/examples/tomo.ecl.txt
 '''
 This is a little 'tomography' problem, taken from an old issue
 of Scientific American.

 A matrix which contains zeroes and ones gets "x-rayed" vertically and
 horizontally, giving the total number of ones in each row and column.
 The problem is to reconstruct the contents of the matrix from this
 information. Sample run:

 ?- go.
   0 0 7 1 6 3 4 5 2 7 0 0
