Fill-a-Pix problem in Google CP Solver.

From
http://www.conceptispuzzles.com/index.aspx?uri=puzzle/fill-a-pix/basiclogic
'''
Each puzzle consists of a grid containing clues in various places. The
object is to reveal a hidden picture by painting the squares around each
clue so that the number of painted squares, including the square with
the clue, matches the value of the clue.
'''

'''
Fill-a-Pix is a Minesweeper-like puzzle based on a grid with a pixilated
picture hidden inside. Using logic alone, the solver determines which
squares are painted and which should remain empty until the hidden picture
is completely exposed.
