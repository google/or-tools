Nurse rostering in Google CP Solver.

This is a simple nurse rostering model using a DFA and
my decomposition of regular constraint.

The DFA is from MiniZinc Tutorial, Nurse Rostering example:
- one day off every 4 days
- no 3 nights in a row.


This model was created by Hakan Kjellerstrand (hakank@gmail.com)
Also see my other Google CP Solver models:

# Global constraint regular

# This is a translation of MiniZinc's regular constraint (defined in
# lib/zinc/globals.mzn), via the Comet code refered above.
# All comments are from the MiniZinc code.
# '''
# The sequence of values in array 'x' (which must all be in the range 1..S)
# is accepted by the DFA of 'Q' states with input 1..S and transition
# function 'd' (which maps (1..Q, 1..S) -> 0..Q)) and initial state 'q0'
# (which must be in 1..Q) and accepting states 'F' (which all must be in
# 1..Q).  We reserve state 0 to be an always failing state.
