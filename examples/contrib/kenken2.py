KenKen puzzle in Google CP Solver.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KenKen
'''
KenKen or KEN-KEN is a style of arithmetic and logical puzzle sharing
several characteristics with sudoku. The name comes from Japanese and
is translated as 'square wisdom' or 'cleverness squared'.
...
The objective is to fill the grid in with the digits 1 through 6 such that:

  * Each row contains exactly one of each digit
  * Each column contains exactly one of each digit
  * Each bold-outlined group of cells is a cage containing digits which
    achieve the specified result using the specified mathematical operation:
      addition (+),
      subtraction (-),
      multiplication (x),
      and division (/).
      (Unlike in Killer sudoku, digits may repeat within a group.)

...
More complex KenKen problems are formed using the principles described
above but omitting the symbols +, -, x and /, thus leaving them as
yet another unknown to be determined.
'''


The solution is:

  5 6 3 4 1 2
  6 1 4 5 2 3
  4 5 2 3 6 1
  3 4 1 2 5 6
  2 3 6 1 4 5
  1 2 5 6 3 4
