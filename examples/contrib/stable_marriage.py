Stable marriage problem in Google CP Solver.

Problem and OPL model from Pascal Van Hentenryck
'The OPL Optimization Programming Language', page 43ff.

Also, see
http://www.comp.rgu.ac.uk/staff/ha/ZCSP/additional_problems/stable_marriage/stable_marriage.pdf

Note: This model is translated from my Comet model
     http://www.hakank.org/comet/stable_marriage.co
I have kept some of the constraint from that code.

Compare with the following models:
* MiniZinc: http://www.hakank.org/minizinc/stable_marriage.mzn
* Comet   : http://www.hakank.org/comet/stable_marriage.co
* ECLiPSe : http://www.hakank.org/eclipse/stable_marriage.ecl
* Gecode  : http://hakank.org/gecode/stable_marriage.cpp
* SICStus : http://hakank.org/sicstus/stable_marriage.pl

This model was created by Hakan Kjellerstrand (hakank@gmail.com)
