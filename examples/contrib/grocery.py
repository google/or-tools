Grocery problem in Google CP Solver.

From  Christian Schulte, Gert Smolka, Finite Domain
http://www.mozart-oz.org/documentation/fdt/
Constraint Programming in Oz. A Tutorial. 2001.
'''
A kid goes into a grocery store and buys four items. The cashier
charges $7.11, the kid pays and is about to leave when the cashier
calls the kid back, and says 'Hold on, I multiplied the four items
instead of adding them; I'll try again; Hah, with adding them the
price still comes to $7.11'. What were the prices of the four items?
