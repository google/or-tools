 Set partition and set covering in Google CP Solver.

 Example from the Swedish book
 Lundgren, Roennqvist, Vaebrand
 'Optimeringslaera' (translation: 'Optimization theory'),
 page 408.

 * Set partition:
   We want to minimize the cost of the alternatives which covers all the
   objects, i.e. all objects must be choosen. The requirement is than an
   object may be selected _exactly_ once.

   Note: This is 1-based representation

   Alternative        Cost        Object
   1                  19           1,6
   2                  16           2,6,8
   3                  18           1,4,7
   4                  13           2,3,5
   5                  15           2,5
   6                  19           2,3
   7                  15           2,3,4
   8                  17           4,5,8
   9                  16           3,6,8
   10                 15           1,6,7

   The problem has a unique solution of z = 49 where alternatives
        3, 5, and 9
   is selected.

 * Set covering:
   If we, however, allow that an object is selected _more than one time_,
   then the solution is z = 45 (i.e. less cost than the first problem),
   and the alternatives
        4, 8, and 10
   is selected, where object 5 is selected twice (alt. 4 and 8).
   It's an unique solution as well.
