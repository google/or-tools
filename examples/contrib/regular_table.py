Global constraint regular in Google CP Solver.

This is a translation of MiniZinc's regular constraint (defined in
lib/zinc/globals.mzn). All comments are from the MiniZinc code.
'''
The sequence of values in array 'x' (which must all be in the range 1..S)
is accepted by the DFA of 'Q' states with input 1..S and transition
function 'd' (which maps (1..Q, 1..S) -> 0..Q)) and initial state 'q0'
(which must be in 1..Q) and accepting states 'F' (which all must be in
1..Q).  We reserve state 0 to be an always failing state.
'''

It is, however, translated from the Comet model:
* Comet: http://www.hakank.org/comet/regular.co

Here we test with the following regular expression:
  0*1{3}0+1{2}0+1{1}0*
using an array of size 10.

This model was created by Hakan Kjellerstrand (hakank@gmail.com)
