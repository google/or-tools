Photo problem in Google CP Solver.

Problem statement from Mozart/Oz tutorial:
http://www.mozart-oz.org/home/doc/fdt/node37.html#section.reified.photo
'''
Betty, Chris, Donald, Fred, Gary, Mary, and Paul want to align in one
row for taking a photo. Some of them have preferences next to whom
they want to stand:

   1. Betty wants to stand next to Gary and Mary.
   2. Chris wants to stand next to Betty and Gary.
   3. Fred wants to stand next to Mary and Donald.
   4. Paul wants to stand next to Fred and Donald.

Obviously, it is impossible to satisfy all preferences. Can you find
an alignment that maximizes the number of satisfied preferences?
'''

Oz solution:
  6 # alignment(betty:5  chris:6  donald:1  fred:3  gary:7   mary:4   paul:2)
[5, 6, 1, 3, 7, 4, 2]
