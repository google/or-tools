Subset sum problem in Google CP Solver.

From Katta G. Murty: 'Optimization Models for Decision Making', page 340
http://ioe.engin.umich.edu/people/fac/books/murty/opti_model/junior-7.pdf
'''
Example 7.8.1

A bank van had several bags of coins, each containing either
16, 17, 23, 24, 39, or 40 coins. While the van was parked on the
street, thieves stole some bags. A total of 100 coins were lost.
It is required to find how many bags were stolen.
