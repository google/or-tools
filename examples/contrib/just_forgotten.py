Just forgotten puzzle (Enigma 1517) in Google CP Solver.

From http://www.f1compiler.com/samples/Enigma 201517.f1.html
'''
Enigma 1517 Bob Walker, New Scientist magazine, October 25, 2008.

Joe was furious when he forgot one of his bank account numbers.
He remembered that it had all the digits 0 to 9 in some order,
so he tried the following four sets without success:

    9 4 6 2 1 5 7 8 3 0
    8 6 0 4 3 9 1 2 5 7
    1 6 4 0 2 9 7 8 5 3
    6 8 2 4 3 1 9 0 7 5

When Joe finally remembered his account number, he realised that
in each set just four of the digits were in their correct position
and that, if one knew that, it was possible to work out his
account number. What was it?
