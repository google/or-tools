Broken weights problem in Google CP Solver.

From http://www.mathlesstraveled.com/?p=701
'''
Here's a fantastic problem I recently heard. Apparently it was first
posed by Claude Gaspard Bachet de Meziriac in a book of arithmetic problems
published in 1612, and can also be found in Heinrich Dorrie's 100
Great Problems of Elementary Mathematics.

    A merchant had a forty pound measuring weight that broke
    into four pieces as the result of a fall. When the pieces were
    subsequently weighed, it was found that the weight of each piece
    was a whole number of pounds and that the four pieces could be
    used to weigh every integral weight between 1 and 40 pounds. What
    were the weights of the pieces?

Note that since this was a 17th-century merchant, he of course used a
balance scale to weigh things. So, for example, he could use a 1-pound
weight and a 4-pound weight to weigh a 3-pound object, by placing the
3-pound object and 1-pound weight on one side of the scale, and
the 4-pound weight on the other side.
