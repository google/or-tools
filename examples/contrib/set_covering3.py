Set covering in Google CP Solver.

Problem from
Katta G. Murty: 'Optimization Models for Decision Making', page 302f
http://ioe.engin.umich.edu/people/fac/books/murty/opti_model/junior-7.pdf

10 senators making a committee, where there must at least be one
representative from each group:
group:        senators:
southern      1 2 3 4 5
northern      6 7 8 9 10
liberals      2 3 8 9 10
conservative  1 5 6 7
democrats     3 4 5 6 7 9
republicans   1 2 8 10

The objective is to minimize the number of senators.

Compare with the following models:
* MiniZinc: http://www.hakank.org/minizinc/set_covering3_model.mzn (model)
            http://www.hakank.org/minizinc/set_covering3.mzn (data)
* Comet   : http://www.hakank.org/comet/set_covering3.co
* ECLiPSe : http://www.hakank.org/eclipse/set_covering3.ecl
* SICStus : http://hakank.org/sicstus/set_covering3.pl
* Gecode  : http://hakank.org/gecode/set_covering3.cpp
