Decomposition of the circuit constraint in Google CP Solver.


Cf Global constraint catalog:
http://www.emn.fr/x-info/sdemasse/gccat/Ccircuit.html

Solution of n=4:
x: [2, 0, 3, 1]
x: [3, 0, 1, 2]
x: [1, 3, 0, 2]
x: [3, 2, 0, 1]
x: [1, 2, 3, 0]
x: [2, 3, 1, 0]

The 'orbit' method that is used here is based on some
observations on permutation orbits.

Compare with the following models:
* MiniZinc: http://www.hakank.org/minizinc/circuit_test.mzn
* Gecode: http://www.hakank.org/gecode/circuit_orbit.mzn
