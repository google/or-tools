Coins grid problem in Google CP Solver.

Problem from
Tony Hurlimann: "A coin puzzle - SVOR-contest 2007"
http://www.svor.ch/competitions/competition2007/AsroContestSolution.pdf
'''
In a quadratic grid (or a larger chessboard) with 31x31 cells, one should
place coins in such a way that the following conditions are fulfilled:
   1. In each row exactly 14 coins must be placed.
   2. In each column exactly 14 coins must be placed.
   3. The sum of the quadratic horizontal distance from the main diagonal
      of all cells containing a coin must be as small as possible.
   4. In each cell at most one coin can be placed.
The description says to place 14x31 = 434 coins on the chessboard each row
containing 14 coins and each column also containing 14 coins.

Cf the LPL model:
