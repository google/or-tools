  Place number puzzle Google CP Solver.

  http://ai.uwaterloo.ca/~vanbeek/Courses/Slides/introduction.pdf
  '''
  Place numbers 1 through 8 on nodes
  - each number appears exactly once
  - no connected nodes have consecutive numbers
       2 - 5
     / | X | \
   1 - 3 - 6 - 8
     \ | X | /
       4 - 7
