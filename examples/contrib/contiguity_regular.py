Global constraint contiguity using regularin Google CP Solver.

This is a decomposition of the global constraint
global contiguity.

From Global Constraint Catalogue
http://www.emn.fr/x-info/sdemasse/gccat/Cglobal_contiguity.html
'''
Enforce all variables of the VARIABLES collection to be assigned to 0 or 1.
In addition, all variables assigned to value 1 appear contiguously.

Example:
(<0, 1, 1, 0>)

The global_contiguity constraint holds since the sequence 0 1 1 0 contains
no more than one group of contiguous 1.

Compare with the following model:
