     * Broken weights problem.
     *
     * From http://www.mathlesstraveled.com/?p=701
     * """
     * Here's a fantastic problem I recently heard. Apparently it was first
     * posed by Claude Gaspard Bachet de Meziriac in a book of arithmetic problems
     * published in 1612, and can also be found in Heinrich Dorrie's 100
     * Great Problems of Elementary Mathematics.
     *
     *   A merchant had a forty pound measuring weight that broke
     *   into four pieces as the result of a fall. When the pieces were
     *   subsequently weighed, it was found that the weight of each piece
     *   was a whole number of pounds and that the four pieces could be
     *   used to weigh every integral weight between 1 and 40 pounds. What
     *   were the weights of the pieces?
     *
     * Note that since this was a 17th-century merchant, he of course used a
     * balance scale to weigh things. So, for example, he could use a 1-pound
     * weight and a 4-pound weight to weigh a 3-pound object, by placing the
     * 3-pound object and 1-pound weight on one side of the scale, and
     * the 4-pound weight on the other side.
