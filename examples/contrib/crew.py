Crew allocation problem  in Google CP Solver.

From Gecode example crew
examples/crew.cc
'''
* Example: Airline crew allocation
*
* Assign 20 flight attendants to 10 flights. Each flight needs a certain
* number of cabin crew, and they have to speak certain languages.
* Every cabin crew member has two flights off after an attended flight.
*
