Mr Smith in Google CP Solver.

From an IF Prolog example (http://www.ifcomputer.de/)
'''
The Smith family and their three children want to pay a visit but they
do not all have the time to do so. Following are few hints who will go
and who will not:
    o If Mr Smith comes, his wife will come too.
    o At least one of their two sons Matt and John will come.
    o Either Mrs Smith or Tim will come, but not both.
    o Either Tim and John will come, or neither will come.
    o If Matt comes, then John and his father will
      also come.
'''

The answer should be:
 Mr_Smith_comes      =  0
 Mrs_Smith_comes     =  0
 Matt_comes          =  0
 John_comes          =  1
 Tim_comes           =  1
