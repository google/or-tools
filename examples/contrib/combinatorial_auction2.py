"""Combinatorial auction in Google CP Solver.

This is a more general model for the combinatorial example
in the Numberjack Tutorial, pages 9 and 24 (slides  19/175 and
51/175).

The original and more talkative model is here:
http://www.hakank.org/numberjack/combinatorial_auction.py

Compare with the following models:
* MiniZinc: http://hakank.org/minizinc/combinatorial_auction.mzn
* Gecode: http://hakank.org/gecode/combinatorial_auction.cpp

This model was created by Hakan Kjellerstrand (hakank@gmail.com)
