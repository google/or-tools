Nonogram  (Painting by numbers) in Google CP Solver.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram
'''
Nonograms or Paint by Numbers are picture logic puzzles in which cells in a
grid have to be colored or left blank according to numbers given at the
side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture. In this puzzle type, the
numbers measure how many unbroken lines of filled-in squares there are
in any given row or column. For example, a clue of '4 8 3' would mean
there are sets of four, eight, and three filled squares, in that order,
with at least one blank square between successive groups.

The Comet model (http://www.hakank.org/comet/nonogram_regular.co)
was a major influence when writing this Google CP solver model.

I have also blogged about the development of a Nonogram solver in Comet
using the regular constraint.
* 'Comet: Nonogram improved: solving problem P200 from 1:30 minutes
   to about 1 second'
   http://www.hakank.org/constraint_programming_blog/2009/03/comet_nonogram_improved_solvin_1.html

* 'Comet: regular constraint, a much faster Nonogram with the regular
constraint,
   some OPL models, and more'
   http://www.hakank.org/constraint_programming_blog/2009/02/comet_regular_constraint_a_muc_1.html

Compare with the other models:
* Gecode/R: http://www.hakank.org/gecode_r/nonogram.rb (using 'regexps')
* MiniZinc: http://www.hakank.org/minizinc/nonogram_regular.mzn
* MiniZinc: http://www.hakank.org/minizinc/nonogram_create_automaton.mzn
* MiniZinc: http://www.hakank.org/minizinc/nonogram_create_automaton2.mzn
  Note: nonogram_create_automaton2.mzn is the preferred model

This model was created by Hakan Kjellerstrand (hakank@gmail.com)
