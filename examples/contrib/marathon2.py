Marathon puzzle in Google CP Solver.

From Xpress example
http://www.dashoptimization.com/home/cgi-bin/example.pl?id=mosel_puzzle_5_3
'''
Dominique, Ignace, Naren, Olivier, Philippe, and Pascal
have arrived as the first six at the Paris marathon.
Reconstruct their arrival order from the following
information:
a) Olivier has not arrived last
b) Dominique, Pascal and Ignace have arrived before Naren
   and Olivier
c) Dominique who was third last year has improved this year.
d) Philippe is among the first four.
e) Ignace has arrived neither in second nor third position.
f) Pascal has beaten Naren by three positions.
g) Neither Ignace nor Dominique are on the fourth position.
