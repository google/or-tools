Divisible by 9 through 1 puzzle in Google CP Solver.

From http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcsharp/ee957404.aspx
' Solving Combinatory Problems with LINQ'
'''
Find a number consisting of 9 digits in which each of the digits
from 1 to 9 appears only once. This number must also satisfy these
divisibility requirements:

 1. The number should be divisible by 9.
 2. If the rightmost digit is removed, the remaining number should
    be divisible by 8.
 3. If the rightmost digit of the new number is removed, the remaining
    number should be divisible by 7.
 4. And so on, until there's only one digit (which will necessarily
    be divisible by 1).

This model is however generalized to handle any base, for reasonable limits.
The 'reasonable limit' for this model is that base must be between 2..16.
