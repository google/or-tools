Moving furnitures (scheduling) problem in Google CP Solver.

Marriott & Stukey: 'Programming with constraints', page  112f

The model implements an experimental decomposition of the
global constraint cumulative.

Compare with the following models:
* ECLiPSE: http://www.hakank.org/eclipse/furniture_moving.ecl
* MiniZinc: http://www.hakank.org/minizinc/furniture_moving.mzn
* Comet: http://www.hakank.org/comet/furniture_moving.co
* Choco: http://www.hakank.org/choco/FurnitureMoving.java
* Gecode: http://www.hakank.org/gecode/furniture_moving.cpp

# Decompositon of cumulative.
#
# Inspired by the MiniZinc implementation:
# http://www.g12.csse.unimelb.edu.au/wiki/doku.php?id=g12:zinc:lib:minizinc:std:cumulative.mzn&s[]=cumulative
# The MiniZinc decomposition is discussed in the paper:
# A. Schutt, T. Feydy, P.J. Stuckey, and M. G. Wallace.
# 'Why cumulative decomposition is not as bad as it sounds.'
