Crypto problem in Google CP Solver.

Martin Gardner (February 1967):
'''
The integers 1,3,8, and 120 form a set with a remarkable property: the
product of any two integers is one less than a perfect square. Find
a fifth number that can be added to the set without destroying
this property.
'''

Solution: The number is 0.

There are however other sets of five numbers with this property.
Here are the one in the range of 0.10000:
[0, 1, 3, 8, 120]
[0, 1, 3, 120, 1680]
[0, 1, 8, 15, 528]
[0, 1, 8, 120, 4095]
[0, 1, 15, 24, 1520]
[0, 1, 24, 35, 3480]
[0, 1, 35, 48, 6888]
[0, 2, 4, 12, 420]
[0, 2, 12, 24, 2380]
[0, 2, 24, 40, 7812]
[0, 3, 5, 16, 1008]
[0, 3, 8, 21, 2080]
[0, 3, 16, 33, 6440]
[0, 4, 6, 20, 1980]
[0, 4, 12, 30, 5852]
[0, 5, 7, 24, 3432]
[0, 6, 8, 28, 5460]
[0, 7, 9, 32, 8160]
