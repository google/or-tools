"""Strimko problem in Google CP Solver.

From
360: A New Twist on Latin Squares
http://threesixty360.wordpress.com/2009/08/04/a-new-twist-on-latin-squares/
'''
The idea is simple: each row and column of an nxn grid must contain
the number 1, 2, ... n exactly once (that is, the grid must form a
Latin square), and each "stream" (connected path in the grid) must
also contain the numbers 1, 2, ..., n exactly once.

I have blogged about this (using MiniZinc model) in
'Strimko - Latin squares puzzle with "streams"'
http://www.hakank.org/constraint_programming_blog/2009/08/strimko_latin_squares_puzzle_w_1.html

Compare with the following models:

* SICStus: http://hakank.org/sicstus/strimko2.pl
