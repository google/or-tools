Coin application in Google CP Solver.

From 'Constraint Logic Programming using ECLiPSe'
pages 99f and 234 ff.
The solution in ECLiPSe is at page 236.

'''
What is the minimum number of coins that allows one to pay _exactly_
any amount smaller than one Euro? Recall that there are six different
euro cents, of denomination 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50
'''
