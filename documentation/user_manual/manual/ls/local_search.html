<p>In the toolbox of Operations Research practitioners, <em>Local Search</em> (LS) is very important as it is often
the best (and sometimes only) method to solve difficult problems. We start this section by describing what Local Search
is and what Local Search methods have in common. Then we discuss their efficiency and compare them with <em>global</em> methods.</p>
<p>Some paragraphs are quite dense, so don&#8217;t be scared if you don&#8217;t &#8220;get it all&#8221; after the first reading. With time and
practice, the use of Local Search methods will become a second nature.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-basic-ingredients">
<h2>6.4.1. The basic ingredients</h2>
<p><em>Local Search</em> is a whole bunch of families of (meta-)heuristics<a class="footnote-reference" href="#meta-explanation" id="id1">[1]</a> that
roughly share the following ingredients:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>They start with a solution (feasible or not);</li>
<li>They improve locally this solution;</li>
<li>They finish the search when reaching a stopping criterion but usually without any
guarantee on the quality of the found solution(s).</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>We will discuss these three ingredients in details in a moment but before here are some examples of
Local Search (meta-)heuristics<a class="footnote-reference" href="#google-scholar-meta-heur-results" id="id2">[2]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Tabu Search</strong> | (62 100)</li>
<li><strong>Hill Climbing</strong> | (54 300)</li>
<li>Scatter Search | (5 600)</li>
<li><strong>Simulated Annealing</strong> | (474 000)</li>
<li>Beam Search | (12 700)</li>
<li>Particle Swarm Optimization | (74 500)</li>
<li>Greedy Descent | (263)</li>
<li>Gradient Search | (16 300)</li>
<li>Variable Neighbourhood Search | (1 620)</li>
<li><strong>Guided Local Search</strong> | (2 020)</li>
<li>Genetic Algorithms | (530 000)</li>
<li>Ant Colony Optimization | (31 100)</li>
<li>Greedy Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP)</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>and there are a lot more! Most of these methods are quite recent in Research Operations (from the eighties and later on).</p>
<p>Most successful methods take into account their search history to guide the search. Even better - when well implemented -
<em>reactive</em> methods<a class="footnote-reference" href="#reactive-search-links" id="id3">[3]</a> learn and adapt themselves during the search.
As you might have guessed from the long list of different
Local Search (meta-) heuristics, there is no universal solving method<a class="footnote-reference" href="#no-free-lunch" id="id4">[4]</a>. The more insight/knowledge of the
structure of your specific problem you gather, the better you can shape your algorithm to solve efficiently your problem.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s discuss the three common ingredients and their implementation in <strong>or-tools</strong>.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first"><strong>They start with a solution</strong> (feasible or not):</p>
<p>To improve locally a solution, you need to start with a solution. In <strong>or-tools</strong> this solution <strong>has to be</strong>
<em>feasible</em>.
You can produce an initial solution and give it to the solver or let the solver find one for you
with a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">DecisionBuilder</span></tt> that you provide the Local Search algorithm with.</p>
<p>What if your problem <em>is</em> to find a feasible solution? You relax the constraints<a class="footnote-reference" href="#relaxing-constraints" id="id5">[5]</a> until
you can
construct a starting solution for that relaxed model. From there, you enforce the relaxed constraints by adding
corresponding terms in the objective function (like in a <em>Lagrangian relaxation</em> for instance).
It might sound complicated but it really isn&#8217;t.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>They improve locally this solution</strong>:</p>
<p>This is the tricky part to understand. Improvements to the initial solution are done <em>locally</em>. This means that
you need to define a <em>neighborhood</em> (explicitly or implicitly) for a given solution and a way to explore this
neighborhood. Two solutions can be <em>close</em> (i.e. they belong to the same neighborhood) or very <em>far</em> apart
depending on the definition of a neighborhood.</p>
<p>The idea is to (partially or completely) explore a neighborhood around an initial solution,
find a good (or the best) solution in this neighborhood and start all over again until a stopping criterion is met.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s denote by  <img class="math" src="../../_images/math/1746aa479b05328a5a521f914f9359d54a17853d.png" alt="\mathcal{N}_x" style="vertical-align: -3px"/> the neighborhood of a solution <img class="math" src="../../_images/math/26eeb5258ca5099acf8fe96b2a1049c48c89a5e6.png" alt="x" style="vertical-align: 0px"/>.</p>
<p>In its very basic form, we could formulate Local Search like this:</p>
<img alt="../../_images/local_search_basic_pseudo_code.png" class="align-center" src="../../_images/local_search_basic_pseudo_code.png" style="height: 100pt;" />
<p>Often, steps 1. and 2. are done simultaneously. This is the case in <strong>or-tools</strong>.</p>
<p>The following figure illustrates this process:</p>
<img alt="../../_images/local_search_basic.png" class="align-center" src="../../_images/local_search_basic.png" style="height: 350pt;" />
<p>This figure depicts a function <img class="math" src="../../_images/math/bb2c93730dbb48558bb3c4738c956c4e8f816437.png" alt="f" style="vertical-align: -4px"/> to minimize. Don&#8217;t be fooled by its 2-dimensionality. The <img class="math" src="../../_images/math/26eeb5258ca5099acf8fe96b2a1049c48c89a5e6.png" alt="x" style="vertical-align: 0px"/>-axis
represents solutions in a multi-dimensional space. The <img class="math" src="../../_images/math/b13f21416d84e13708696f34dea81026cda583c9.png" alt="z" style="vertical-align: 0px"/>-axis represents a 1-dimensional space with the values
of the objective function <img class="math" src="../../_images/math/bb2c93730dbb48558bb3c4738c956c4e8f816437.png" alt="f" style="vertical-align: -4px"/>.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s zoom in on the neighborhoods and found solutions:</p>
<img alt="../../_images/local_search_basic_zoom.png" class="align-center" src="../../_images/local_search_basic_zoom.png" style="height: 150pt;" />
<p>The Local Search procedure starts from an initial feasible solution <img class="math" src="../../_images/math/17f1249ad95b7682b8316ad21de8ce4ee9fdcf93.png" alt="x_0" style="vertical-align: -3px"/> and searches the neighborhood
<img class="math" src="../../_images/math/854fdd1c13fecf3dd523f70c6920c1dbecbdc8e4.png" alt="\mathcal{N}_{x_0}" style="vertical-align: -4px"/> of this solution. The &#8220;best&#8221; solution found is <img class="math" src="../../_images/math/ccada11db7b2b90693e2fac4f887a57fce6f96bf.png" alt="x_1" style="vertical-align: -4px"/>. The Local Search procedure
starts over again but with <img class="math" src="../../_images/math/ccada11db7b2b90693e2fac4f887a57fce6f96bf.png" alt="x_1" style="vertical-align: -4px"/> as starting solution. In the neighborhood <img class="math" src="../../_images/math/9b7d8d158752c51d5ac33069fe6ef47d0a566193.png" alt="\mathcal{N}_{x_1}" style="vertical-align: -5px"/>, the best solution found is
<img class="math" src="../../_images/math/6a7d010bbff66a0c41e43310a51efbaa6bf63396.png" alt="x_2" style="vertical-align: -3px"/>. The procedure continues on and on until stopping criteria are met. Let&#8217;s say that one of these criteria is
met and the search ends with <img class="math" src="../../_images/math/ee60922c5fc5ee1941df04f838cdae71fbc29d6f.png" alt="x_3" style="vertical-align: -3px"/>. You can see that while the method moves towards the local optima, it
misses it and completely misses the global optimum! This is why the method is called <em>local</em> search: it probably
will find a local optimum (or come close to) but it is unable to find a global optimum (except by chance).</p>
<p>If we had continued the search, chances are that our procedure would have iterated around the local optimum.
In this case, we say that the Local Search algorithm is <em>trapped by a local optimum</em>.
Some LS methods - like
Tabu Search - were developed to escape such local optimum but again there is no guarantee whatsoever that they
can succeed.</p>
<p>The figure above is very instructive. For instance, you can see that neighborhoods don&#8217;t have to be of equal size or
centred around a variable <img class="math" src="../../_images/math/67bc6daa9d6b964201d6cef60cbeb1ac5fd26ead.png" alt="x_i" style="vertical-align: -3px"/>. You can also see that the relationship &#8220;being in the neighborhood of&#8221; is
not necessarily symmetric: <img class="math" src="../../_images/math/d496c9ad339a4c8be51a94053cc0b95e45e1d234.png" alt="x_1 \in \mathcal{N}_{x_0}" style="vertical-align: -4px"/> but <img class="math" src="../../_images/math/30cc8dd93b06f653d270b1fc3f9de45965b3f472.png" alt="x_0 \not \in \mathcal{N}_{x_1}" style="vertical-align: -5px"/><a class="footnote-reference" href="#being-in-the-neighborhood-not-symmetric" id="id6">[6]</a>!</p>
<p>In <strong>or-tools</strong>, you define a neighborhood by implementing the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MakeNextNeighbor()</span></tt> callback method<a class="footnote-reference" href="#make-one-neighbor-callback" id="id7">[7]</a> from a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">LocalSearchOperator</span></tt>: every time
this method is called internally by the solver, it constructs one solution of the neighborhood.
If you have constructed a successful candidate, make <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MakeNextNeighbor()</span></tt> returns <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">true</span></tt>.
When the whole neighborhood
has been visited, make it returns <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">false</span></tt>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>They finish the search when reaching a stopping criterion but usually without any
guarantee on the quality of the found solution(s)</strong>:</p>
<p>Common stopping criteria include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>time limits:<ul>
<li>for the whole solving process or</li>
<li>for some parts of the solving process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>maximum number of steps/iterations:<ul>
<li>maximum number of branches;</li>
<li>maximum number of failures;</li>
<li>maximum number of solutions;</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>improvements criteria:<ul>
<li>stop if no improvement for n number of steps/x time;</li>
<li>stop if gap between estimate of optimal solution and best solution obtained so far is smaller than x;</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These stopping criteria can be further divided in:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><em>absolute</em>: for instance, a global maximal number of iterations;</li>
<li><em>relative</em>: for instance, the improvements are too small with respect to the time,
the number of iterations, the number of solutions, ... .</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Most of the time, you combine some of these criteria together. You can also update them during the search.
In <strong>or-tools</strong>, stopping criteria are implemented using specialized <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SearchMonitor</span></tt>s: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SearchLimit</span></tt>s
(see the subsection <a class="reference internal" href="../objectives/data_search.html#search-limits"><em>SearchLimits</em></a>).</p>

<div class="topic" id="topic-word-meta">
<p class="topic-title first">What is it with the word <em>meta</em><a class="footnote-reference" href="#meta-meaning-wiki" id="id8">[8]</a>?</p>
<p>A heuristic is an algorithm that provides a (hopefully) good solution
for a given problem. A <em>meta</em>-heuristic is more like a theoretical framework to solve
problems: you have to adapt the meta-heuristic to your needs. For instance, <em>Genetic Algorithms</em>
use a recombination of parts of solutions (the genes) but for a specific problem, you have to find
out what parts of solution you can combine and how you can combine them. A meta-heuristic gives you
guidelines to construct your algorithm.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a recipe on how to write a recipe. You have one level of indirection
like in <em>meta</em>-programming where you write code to generate code.</p>

<div class="section" id="is-local-search-efficient">
<span id="local-search-efficiency"></span><h2>6.4.2. Is Local Search efficient?</h2>
<p>In two words: <strong>yes</strong> but...<a class="footnote-reference" href="#and-three-more-dots" id="id9">[9]</a></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s dissect this terse answer:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>yes</strong>:</p>
<p>To really answer this question, you need to know what exactly you mean by &#8220;efficient&#8221;.
If you&#8217;re
looking for a global optimum then Local Search - at least in its basic form but read the subsection
<a class="reference internal" href="#global-optimization-methods"><em>Global optimization methods and Local Search</em></a> below - is probably not for you. If you are looking for a guarantee on the quality
of the solution(s) found, then again you might want to look for another tool.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">but...:</p>
<p>Local search methods are strongly dependent on your knowledge of the problem and your ability to use this
knowledge during the search. For instance, very often the initial solution plays a crucial role in the
efficiency of the Local Search. You might start from a solution
that is too far from a global (or local) optimum or worse you start from a solution from which it is impossible to reach a global
(or even local) optimum with your neighborhood definition. Several techniques have been proposed to tackle these annoyances.
One of them is to restart the search with different initial solutions. Another is to change the definition of
a neighborhood during the search like in <em>Variable Neighbourhood Search (VNS)</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>LS is a tradeoff between efficiency and the fact that LS doesn&#8217;t try to find a global optimum, i.e. in other words you are
willing to give up the
idea of finding a global optimum for the satisfaction to quickly find a (hopefully good) local optimum.</p>
<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title first">A certain blindness</p>
<p>LS methods are most of the time really blind when they search. Often you hear the analogy between LS methods and
descending a hill<a class="footnote-reference" href="#ls-descending-a-hill-metaphor" id="id10">[10]</a> to find the lowest point in a valley (when we minimize a function). It would be more appropriate
to compare LS methods with going down a valley flooded by mist: you don&#8217;t see very far in what direction to go to
continue downhill. Sometimes you don&#8217;t see anything at all and you don&#8217;t even know if you are allowed to set a foot in
front of you!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-about-the-quality-of-the-solutions-found-by-local-search">
<h2>6.4.3. What about the quality of the solutions found by Local Search?</h2>
<p>Sometimes, we can have some kind of guarantee on the quality of the solutions found and we speak
about <em>approximations</em>, sometimes we don&#8217;t have a clue of what we are doing and we just hope
for the best.</p>
<p>Most of the time, we face two non satisfactory situations:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>a good guarantee is expensive to compute (sometimes as expensive as finding a good solution or even more!);</li>
<li>a guarantee that isn&#8217;t very expensive to compute but that is close to being useless.</li>
</ul>
<p>In either cases, it is not worth computing this guarantee<a class="footnote-reference" href="#not-every-problem-has-a-guarantee" id="id11">[11]</a>.</p>
<p>Not having a theoretical guarantee on the quality of a solution doesn&#8217;t mean that the solution found is not a good solution
(it might even be the best solution), just that we don&#8217;t know how good (or bad) this solution is!</p>
<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title first">What do we mean by a <em>guarantee</em> on the solution?</p>
<p>Several concepts of <em>guarantee</em> have been developed. We will not go into details
about the concept of
<em>guarantee</em> but let&#8217;s give an example. In a now famous report <a class="reference internal" href="#christofides1976">[Christofides1976]</a>, Christofides proposed and analyzed a
heuristic that is guaranteed to solve the metric Travelling Salesman Problem<a class="footnote-reference" href="#metrictsp" id="id13">[12]</a> within a 3/2 factor, i.e.
no matter the instance, this heuristic will always return a solution whose cost is at most 3/2 times
the cost of the optimal solution. This means that in the worst case, the returned solution costs
3/2 times the cost of the optimal solution. This <strong>is</strong> guaranteed!</p>
<p>See <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximation_algorithm">Wikipedia Approximation Algorithm</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="global-optimization-methods-and-local-search">
<span id="global-optimization-methods"></span><h2>6.4.4. Global optimization methods and Local Search</h2>
<p>Meta-heuristics and heuristics can also work globally<a class="footnote-reference" href="#local-global-heuristics" id="id14">[13]</a>.
The challenge with global methods is that very often the global search space for real industrial instances
is huge and contains lots of dimensions
(sometimes millions or even more!). More often than not, global exact optimization algorithms take prohibitive times
to solve such instances. Global (meta-)heuristics cannot dredge the search space too much in details for the same reason.</p>
<p>So, on one hand we can skim through the whole space search but not too much in details and on the other hand we have
(very) efficient local methods that (hopefully) lead to local optima. Could we have the best of these two worlds?</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve guessed it: we use global methods to find portions of the search space that might contain good or even optimal
solutions and we try to find those with Local Search methods. As always, there is a tradeoff between the two.</p>
<p>To take again an analogy<a class="footnote-reference" href="#analogy-limits" id="id15">[14]</a>, looking for a good solution this way is a bit like trying to find
crude oil (or nowadays tar sands and the like): you send engineers, geologists, etc. to some places on earth to prospect
(global method).
If they find a promising spot, you send a team to drill and find out (local method).</p>
