<span id="id1"></span><h1>1.4. A little bit of theory</h1>
<p>Here you will find some important ideas and
the vocabulary we use throughout this manual. As is often the case with theory, if you don&#8217;t have some first-hand experience with
practice (in this case <em>mathematical optimization</em>), you might find it difficult to follow the theoretical abstraction and technicalities.
To help you get mixed up, experts often mix terms and use (wrongly formulated) shortcuts when they describe their theory. Optimization is certainly no exception. We&#8217;ll try to be as clear as
possible and use specific examples to illustrate the most important concepts. We also try not to oversimplify too much but from time to time, we do to give you
a a simple formulation to a complex theory.</p>
<p>In the subsection <a class="reference internal" href="#constraint-satisfaction-problem"><em>Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP) and Constraint Optimization Problems (COP)</em></a>,
we cover the basic vocabulary used to describe the problems we solve in CP. The subsection
<a class="reference internal" href="#complexity-in-a-few-lines"><em>Complexity theory in a few lines</em></a> is an informal introduction to <em>complexity theory</em><a class="footnote-reference" href="#time-complexity" id="id2">[1]</a>.
One of the difficulties of this
theory is that there are lots of technical details no to be missed. We introduce you to important ideas without being drawn into too many details
(some <em>unavoidable</em> details can be found in the footnotes).</p>
<p>Complexity theory is relatively new (it really started in the &#8216;70s)
and is not easy (and after reading this section, you&#8217;ll probably have more questions than answers).
If you are allergic to theory, skip subsection <a class="reference internal" href="#complexity-in-a-few-lines"><em>Complexity theory in a few lines</em></a>. We are convinced - we took the time to write it, right? - that
you would benefit from reading this section in its entirety but it is up to you. You might want to read the important <strong>practical</strong> implications of this
complexity theory in the subsection <a class="reference internal" href="#pratical-aspect-of-intractability"><em>The practical aspect of intractability</em></a> though.</p>

<p>We illustrate the different components of a
Constraint Satisfaction Problem with the 4-Queens problem we saw in the section <a class="reference internal" href="4queens.html#four-queens-problem"><em>The 4-Queens Problem</em></a>.
Each time, we use a general definition (for instance variable <img class="math" src="../../_images/math/67bc6daa9d6b964201d6cef60cbeb1ac5fd26ead.png" alt="x_i" style="vertical-align: -3px"/>) and then illustrate this definition by
the 4-Queens problem (for instance variable <img class="math" src="../../_images/math/b77453505fc5ba87f06001a293090b221374b9be.png" alt="x_{21}" style="vertical-align: -4px"/>).</p>
<p id="index-0">A <strong>Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)</strong> consists of</p>

<p>For the 4-Queens Problem, we have a binary variable <img class="math" src="../../_images/math/9ff77ee087b4287c6e82e414efbe4d79aba8c012.png" alt="x_{ij}" style="vertical-align: -6px"/> indicating the presence or not of a queen

</div></li>
<li><p class="first">a set of <strong>constraints</strong> that restrict the values the variables can take simultaneously.</p>
<p>For the 4-Queens Problem, we have a set of constraints that forbid two queens (or more) to share the same row:</p>

\text{row 3:} &amp; x_{30} + x_{31} + x_{32} + x_{33} &amp; \leqslant &amp; 1\\
\end{array}"/></p>
</div><p>Indeed, these constraints ensure that for each row <img class="math" src="../../_images/math/34857b3ba74ce5cd8607f3ebd23e9015908ada71.png" alt="i" style="vertical-align: 0px"/> at most one variable

Actually, we could replace the inequalities by equalities because
we know that every feasible solution must have a queen on each row<a class="footnote-reference" href="#what-exactly-is-the-nqueens-problem" id="id3">[2]</a>. Later, in the
section <a class="reference internal" href="../search_primitives/basic_model_implementation.html#nqueen-implementation-basic-model"><em>Implementation of a basic model</em></a>, we will provide
another model with different variables and constraints.</p>

</ul>

<p>As we mentioned earlier, values don&#8217;t need to be integers and constraints don&#8217;t need to be
algebraic equations or inequalities<a class="footnote-reference" href="#only-constraint-on-constraint-in-cp" id="id4">[3]</a>.</p>
<p id="index-1">If we want to <em>optimize</em>, i.e. to <em>minimize</em> or <em>maximize</em> an <em>objective function</em>, we talk about a <strong>Constraint Optimization
Problem (COP)</strong>. The <strong>objective function</strong> can be one of the variables of the problem or a function of some or all the variables. Most of the problems
used in this manual fall into this category. In this manual, we&#8217;ll discuss among others:</p>

<div class="section" id="problems-instances-and-solutions">
<span id="problems-instances-solutions"></span><h2>1.4.2. Problems, instances and solutions</h2>
<p id="index-2">We will not go into details about what a <em>mathematical</em> problem exactly is. As an example, we met the n-Queens Problem in the section <a class="reference internal" href="4queens.html#four-queens-problem"><em>The 4-Queens Problem</em></a>. We would like to take the time
to differentiate <em>mathematical</em> problems from <em>real</em> problems though. Let&#8217;s take an example. Let&#8217;s say you are a company and want to give your users the ability to view streets from the comfort
of their browsers as if they were physically present in those remote locations. To provide such a service, you might want to scour the globe with special cars and other mobile means to take some pictures.
This is a <em>real</em> problem from <em>real</em> life. How do you provide such a service? Mathematical optimization to the rescue! Subdivide this real (and challenging!) problem into smaller ones and translate
them into (solvable) mathematical problems:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Taking pictures? All and well but how do you actually do this? How many pictures do you need to take? At what angle? How do you morph them together and minimize distortion? Etc....</li>
<li>How do you scour the streets of a city? At what speed? How close to pictured objects? With how many cars? At what time of the day? After covering a street, where should the car head next? What about turns? Etc....</li>
<li>How do you keep such information on the servers? How do you match the pictures with the correct locations? How do you respond to a user request such that she gets the most relevant information as quickly
as possible? Etc....</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>Believe it or not, you can translate those questions into mathematical problems. And these (some of them at least) mathematical problems can be (and are!) solved with tools like the <em>or-tools</em> library.</p>
<p>Mathematical problems are a translation of such real problems into mathematical terms. We&#8217;ll see many of them in this manual. Interestingly enough, the <em>or-tools</em> CP solver doesn&#8217;t have a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Model</span></tt> class
on its own as the model is constructed in/by the solver itself but you have some classes that relate to the mathematical model the solver is trying to solve. Among them, you have a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ModelVisitor</span></tt> class that lets you <em>visit</em> the model and act upon it.</p>
<p id="index-3">These mathematical problems are sort of theoretical templates. What you want to solve with a computer are specific versions of a problem. For instance, the n-Queens problem with <img class="math" src="../../_images/math/3bd075cc63abd292fe7a0f0fb52afd8390ca5649.png" alt="n=37" style="vertical-align: 0px"/> or
<img class="math" src="../../_images/math/49526bc5b02da6810703a5620d7854599938ee9d.png" alt="n=6484" style="vertical-align: -1px"/>, or a Travelling Salesman Problem on a particular graph representing the city of New York. We call these practical materialization of a mathematical problem <strong>instances</strong>. You try
to find mathematical theoretical methods to solve mathematical problems and solve specific instances on your computer<a class="footnote-reference" href="#instances-vs-problems" id="id5">[4]</a>. When you ask the CP solver to print a model, you
are in fact asking for a specific instance.</p>
<p id="index-4">A <strong>solution</strong> of an instance is an assignment of the variables: each variable is assigned a value of its domain. This doesn&#8217;t mean that a <em>solution</em> solves your problem: the assignment doesn&#8217;t need
to respect the constraints! A <strong>feasible solution</strong> to a CSP or a COP is a <em>feasible</em> assignment: every variable has been assigned a value from its domain
in such a way that <strong>all</strong> the constraints of the model are satisfied. The <em>or-tools</em> CP solver uses the class <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Assignment</span></tt> to represent a solution. As its mathematical counterpart, it can represent a valid (i.e. a feasible) solution or not. When we have a feasible solution, we&#8217;ll talk about a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Solution</span></tt> (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SolutionCollector</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SolutionPool</span></tt> classes or the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">NextSolution()</span></tt> method for instance) in <em>or-tools</em> although there is no
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Solution</span></tt> class. The <strong>objective value</strong> of a feasible solution is
the value of the objective function for this solution. In <em>or-tools</em>, the objective function is modeled by the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">OptimizeVar</span></tt> class, i.e. it is a variable.
An <strong>optimal solution</strong> to a COP is a feasible solution such
that there are no other solutions with better objective values. Note that an optimal solution doesn&#8217;t need to exist nor is it
unique in general. For instance, we&#8217;ll see that the n-Queens Problem or the Golomb Ruler Problem both possess several optimal solutions.</p>
<p>Let us emphasize that the or-tools CP-solver deals only with discrete and finite variables, i.e. the values
a variable can take are elements of a finite set. If you want to solve a continuous problem,
you need to <em>discretize</em> it, i.e. model your problem with variables over a finite domain.</p>

<div class="section" id="complexity-theory-in-a-few-lines">
<span id="complexity-in-a-few-lines"></span><h2>1.4.4. Complexity theory in a few lines</h2>
<p id="index-5">Some problems such as the <em>Travelling Salesman Problem</em> (see the chapter <a class="reference internal" href="../TSP.html#chapter-tsp-with-constraints"><em>Travelling Salesman Problems with constraints: the TSP with time windows</em></a>)
are hard to solve<a class="footnote-reference" href="#difficult-to-solve" id="id9">[8]</a>:
no one could ever come up
with an efficient algorithm to solve this problem. On the other hand, other problems,
like the <em>n-Queens Problem</em>
(see the chapter <a class="reference internal" href="../search_primitives.html#chapter-search-primitives"><em>Defining search primitives: the n-Queens Problem</em></a>), are solved very efficiently<a class="footnote-reference" href="#precision-on-both-problems" id="id10">[9]</a>.
In the &#8216;70s, complexity experts were able to translate this
fact into a beautiful <em>complexity theory</em>.</p>
<p>Hard to solve problems are called <em>intractable</em> problems. When you cannot solve an intractable
problem to optimality, you can
try to find good solutions or/and <em>approximate</em> the problem. In the &#8216;90s, complexity experts continued their
investigation on the
complexity of solving problems and developed what is now known as the <em>approximation complexity theory</em>. Both theories
are quite new,
very interesting and ... not easy to understand. We try the <em>tour the force</em> to introduce the basics of the general complexity theory in a few lines.
We willingly kept certain technical details out of the way. These technical details <em>are important</em> and actually without
them, you can not construct a complexity theory.</p>
<div class="section" id="intractability">
<span id="id11"></span><h3>1.4.4.1. Intractability</h3>
<p>One of the main difficulties complexity experts faced in the &#8216;70s was to come up with a theoretical
definition of the complexity
of problems not algorithms. Indeed, it is relatively easy<a class="footnote-reference" href="#complexity-algo-difficult" id="id12">[11]</a> to define a complexity measure of
algorithms but how would you define
the complexity of a problem? If you have an efficient algorithm to solve a problem, you could say that the problem
belongs to the set of easy problems but what about difficult problems?
The fact that we don&#8217;t know an efficient algorithm to solve
these doesn&#8217;t mean these problems are really difficult. Someone could come up one day with an efficient algorithm.
The solution the experts came up with was to build equivalence classes between problems and define the complexity of
a problem with respect to the complexity of other problems (so the notion of complexity is relative not absolute<a class="footnote-reference" href="#complexity-relative-for-hard-problems" id="id13">[10]</a>):

instances of two problems to prove &#8220;equivalent&#8221; complexities.</p>
<p>This main idea leads to a lot of technicalities:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>how to exactly measure the complexity of an algorithm?</li>
<li>what is an efficient transformation/reduction?</li>
<li>what are the requirements for such a reduction?</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>We don&#8217;t answer these interesting questions except the one on efficiency. We consider a reduction
<img class="math" src="../../_images/math/1dc1c0119a604b91be9142370dc3159b6a9bbcb9.png" alt="\tau" style="vertical-align: 0px"/> <em>efficient</em>
if there exist a polynomial-time bounded algorithm (this refers to the first question...) that can transform any
instance <img class="math" src="../../_images/math/8136a7ef6a03334a7246df9097e5bcc31ba33fd2.png" alt="b" style="vertical-align: 0px"/> of problem <img class="math" src="../../_images/math/ff5fb3d775862e2123b007eb4373ff6cc1a34d4e.png" alt="B" style="vertical-align: 0px"/> into an instance <img class="math" src="../../_images/math/c7d457e388298246adb06c587bccd419ea67f7e8.png" alt="a" style="vertical-align: 0px"/> of problem <img class="math" src="../../_images/math/019e9892786e493964e145e7c5cf7b700314e53b.png" alt="A" style="vertical-align: 0px"/> such that the solutions
correspond. This also means that we
consider an algorithm <em>efficient</em> if it is <em>polynomially time-bounded</em> (otherwise the efficiency of the
reduction would be useless).</p>
<p>The class of problems that can be efficiently solved is called <img class="math" src="../../_images/math/4b4cade9ca8a2c8311fafcf040bc5b15ca507f52.png" alt="P" style="vertical-align: 0px"/>, i.e. the class of problems that can be solved by

<p>Some problems are difficult to solve but once you have an answer, it is quite straightforward to verify that a
given solution is indeed the solution of the problem. One such problem is the <em>Hamiltonian Path Problem (HPP)</em>.
Given a graph, is there a path that visits each vertex exactly once? Finding such a path is difficult but verifying
that a given path is indeed an Hamiltonian path, i.e. that it passes exactly once through each vertex, can be
easily done. Problems for which solutions are easy to verify, i.e. for which this verification can be done
in polynomial time, are said to be in the class <img class="math" src="../../_images/math/35e650cafa2f70ede1a3563843e1f75c539761f8.png" alt="NP" style="vertical-align: 0px"/><a class="footnote-reference" href="#np-term" id="id17">[15]</a>. <img class="math" src="../../_images/math/0a9e39774d93f4876b7a540ea26f6fa9c6b756de.png" alt="P \subset NP" style="vertical-align: -1px"/> because if you can
find a solution in polynomial time, you can also verify this solution in polynomial time (just construct it).
Whether we have equality or not
between these two sets is one of the major unsolved theoretical questions in Operations Research (see the box

<p>Wait a minute. There is an infinite number of problems in <img class="math" src="../../_images/math/e12ea0577ff0b662bec381b5f35dc3dbd9c3339f.png" alt="\text{NP}" style="vertical-align: -1px"/>, many of which are unknown to us.

<p>This can done in two steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">First, notice that the reduction is <em>transitive</em>. This means that if <img class="math" src="../../_images/math/afc8ad1f66ffd169e136847ae1657634c76a2b01.png" alt="A \leqslant_{\text{T}} B" style="vertical-align: -4px"/>

<span id="pratical-aspect-of-intractability"></span><h3>1.4.4.2. The practical aspect of intractability</h3>
<p>If you try to solve a problem that is proven to be <img class="math" src="../../_images/math/8ed27d32851b0b1fac3aa7982c862daf59f21d46.png" alt="\text{NP-Hard}" style="vertical-align: -1px"/>, you know that it is
probably an intractable problem (if <img class="math" src="../../_images/math/4811a569c64f4862145541b21ecdcff2798ad9bb.png" alt="P \neq NP" style="vertical-align: -4px"/>). At least, you know that no one could ever come with an efficient
algorithm to solve it and that it is unlikely to happen soon. Thus, you are not able to solve exactly &#8220;big&#8221; instances of your
problem. What can you do?</p>
<p>Maybe there are special cases that can be solved in polynomial time? If you are not interested in those cases and
your instances are too big to be solved exactly, even with parallel and/or decomposition algorithms, then there is only
one thing to do: approximate your problem and/or the solutions.</p>
<p>You could simplify your problem and/or be satisfied with an approximation, i.e. a solution that is not exact nor optimal.
One way to do this in CP is to relax the model by softening some constraints<a class="footnote-reference" href="#softening-constraints" id="id26">[21]</a>. In a nutshell,
you soften a constraint by allowing this constraint to be violated. In a approximate solution where the constraint is
violated, you penalize the objective function by a certain amount corresponding to the violation. The bigger the
violation, the bigger the penalty. The idea is to find a solution that doesn&#8217;t violate too much the soft constraints in
the hope that such approximate solution isn&#8217;t that different from an exact or optimal solution<a class="footnote-reference" href="#different-solution-optimization" id="id27">[22]</a>.</p>
<p>Another possible research avenue is to use <em>(meta-)heuristics</em>: algorithms that hopefully return good or even near-optimal
solutions. Some of these algorithms give a guarantee on the quality of the produced solutions, some don&#8217;t
and you just hope for the best. You can also monitor the quality of the solutions by trying to close the <em>optimality gap</em> as
much as possible. Given an instance, compute a <em>lower bound</em> <img class="math" src="../../_images/math/10f32377ac67d94f764f12a15ea987e88c85d3e1.png" alt="\alpha" style="vertical-align: 0px"/> and an <em>upper bound</em> <img class="math" src="../../_images/math/fdb63b9e51abe6bbb16acfb5d7b773ddbb5bf4a8.png" alt="\beta" style="vertical-align: -4px"/> on the
optimal value <img class="math" src="../../_images/math/59f327b60c02506ded1dccdc34b1df7a509e8044.png" alt="z^*" style="vertical-align: 0px"/>. So you know that <img class="math" src="../../_images/math/6d76de0e4f0ec475d7d710d006b1d25e2164910a.png" alt="z^* \in [\alpha, \beta]" style="vertical-align: -5px"/>. <em>Closing the optimality gap</em> is trying
to shrink this interval by producing better upper and lower bounds. If you manage to produce solutions with
objective values belonging to this interval, you know how close (or not) these values are from the optimal value of your
instance.</p>
<p>As with exact optimization, an approximation complexity theory emerged. It started in the &#8216;90 and is now a mature domain that improves greatly our comprehension
of what we can or can not (theorically) compute. There is a whole zoo of complexity classes. Some problems can be approximated but without any
guarantee on the quality of the solutions, others can be approximated with as much precision as you desire but
you have to pay the price for this precision: the more precision you want the slower your algorithms will be.
For some problems it is hard to find approximations and for others, it is even impossible to find an approximation with
any guarantee whatsoever on its quality!</p>

<em>decision problems</em>, i.e. problems that have a <em>yes/no</em> answer. The <em>Subset Sum Problem</em> is such a problem.
Given a finite set of integers, is there a non-empty subset whose sum is zero? The answer is yes or no. By extension,
we say an optimization problem is in <img class="math" src="../../_images/math/4b4cade9ca8a2c8311fafcf040bc5b15ca507f52.png" alt="P" style="vertical-align: 0px"/>, if its equivalent <em>decision problem</em> is in <img class="math" src="../../_images/math/4b4cade9ca8a2c8311fafcf040bc5b15ca507f52.png" alt="P" style="vertical-align: 0px"/>. For instance,
the Chinese Postman Problem (CPP) is an optimization problem where one wants to find a minimal route
traversing all edges
of a graph. The equivalent decision problem is &#8221; <em>Is it possible to find a feasible route with cost less or equal
