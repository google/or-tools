# CI: Makefile/Docker testing

To test the build on various distro, I'm using docker containers and a Makefile
for orchestration.

pros:

*   You are independent of third party CI runner config (e.g. github actions
    runners or Travis-CI VM images).
*   You can run it locally on your linux system.
*   Most CI provide runner with docker and Makefile installed (e.g. tarvis-ci
    [minimal images](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/minimal-and-generic/).

cons:

* Only GNU/Linux distro supported.
* Could take few GiB (~30 GiB for all distro and all languages)
  * ~500MiB OS + C++/CMake tools,
  * ~150 MiB Python,
  * ~400 MiB dotnet-sdk,
  * ~400 MiB java-jdk.

## Usage
To get the help simply type:
```sh
make
```

note: you can also use from top directory
```sh
make --directory=makefiles
```

### Example
For example to test `Python` inside an `Alpine` container:
```sh
make alpine_python_test
```

## Docker layers
Dockerfile is split in several stages.
