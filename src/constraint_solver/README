<summary>Constraint Programming (CP) and Routing extensions.</summary>

Constraint Programming
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_programming) is a technology
issued from IA and used in Operations Research.

Vehicle Routing (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_routing)
is a useful extension that is implemented on top of the CP library.

- constraint_solver.h: The point of entry for all constraint programming users.

- constraint_solveri.h: An additional file that helps extending the constraint
  programming library.

- routing.h: The point of entry for routing problems.

- constraint_solver.swig: SWIG instructions to wrap the C++ library in python
  and java.

- model.proto:  Holds the description of a constraint programming problem,
  i.e. the input of the solver.

- assignment.proto: Holds the solution of a CP problem.

- search_limit.proto:  Holds parameters to limit the search space within
  the CP solver, which is important for performance.

- demon_profiler.proto: Holds the timeline and execution profile of
  constraints and demons (daemons).
