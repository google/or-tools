// - MODEL_SAT: The problem has been solved to optimality.

// Testing. (SAT’06), LNCS 4121.

// This algorithm requires all the objective weights to be the same (CHECKed)
// and currently only works on minization problems. The problem is assumed to be
// already loaded into the given solver.
//
// TODO(user): double-check the correctness if the objective coefficients are
// negative.
