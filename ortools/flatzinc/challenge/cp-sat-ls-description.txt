CP-SAT-LS is a discrete optimization solver built on top of a SAT engine.

It is available within the OR-Tools open-source repository
   - website: https://developers.google.com/optimization
   - github repository: https://github.com/google/or-Tools
It has won multiple gold medals at the MiniZinc challenge:
    https://www.minizinc.org/challenge.html since its debut in 2017.

The CP-SAT-LS solver is a pure Local Search solver using the same interface as
the CP-SAT solver.

It is build on top of the Feasibility Jump article:
