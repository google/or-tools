// Represents a capacity constraint to be used in conjunction with a
// SetCoverProto. This constraint only considers one dimension.
//
// Such a capacity constraint mathematically looks like:
//     min_capacity <= \sum_{e in elements} weight_e * x_e <= max_capacity
// where either `min_capacity` or `max_capacity` can be omitted. `x_e` indicates
// for a given solution `x` whether the element `e` is selected and counts for
// this capacity constraint (`x_e == 1`) or not (`x_e == 0`). The weights are
// given in `capacity_term`, each of them being a reference to an element being
// present in a subset (in set-covering parlance) and its weight.
//
// For instance, this constraint can be used together with a set-covering
// problem where parcels (element) must be covered by trucks (subsets) while
// respecting truck capacities (this object). Each element can be covered by a
// given set of trucks (set-covering problem); if an element is taken within a
// truck, it uses some capacity for this truck (such as weight).
//
// In particular, this representation does not imply that a given element must
// have the same weight in all the capacity constraints of a set-covering
// problem (e.g., the same parcel might have different weights depending on
// which truck is being considered).

  // subset).
