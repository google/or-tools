    Statuses are as claimed by the solver and a dual relaxation is the dual of a

    MIP). The solver is not required to return a certificate for the feasibility
    or infeasibility claims (e.g. the solver may claim primal feasibility without
    returning a primal feasible solutuion). This combined status gives a
    comprehensive description of a solver's claims about feasibility and
    unboundedness of the solved problem. For instance,
      * a feasible status for primal and dual problems indicates the primal is
        feasible and bounded and likely has an optimal solution (guaranteed for
        problems without non-linear constraints).
      * a primal feasible and a dual infeasible status indicates the primal
        problem is unbounded (i.e. has arbitrarily good solutions).
    Note that a dual infeasible status by itself (i.e. accompanied by an
    undetermined primal status) does not imply the primal problem is unbounded as
    we could have both problems be infeasible. Also, while a primal and dual
    feasible status may imply the existence of an optimal solution, it does not
    guarantee the solver has actually found such optimal solution.

        dual_problem_status = kUndetermined. This extra information is often

    We attempt to return as much solution information (primal_solutions,
    primal_rays, dual_solutions, dual_rays) as each underlying solver will provide
    given its return status. Differences in the underlying solvers result in a
    weak contract on what fields will be populated for a given termination
    reason. This is discussed in detail in termination_reasons.md, and the most
    important points are summarized below:
      * When the termination reason is optimal, there will be at least one primal
        solution provided that will be feasible up to the underlying solver's
        tolerances.
      * Dual solutions are only given for convex optimization problems (e.g.
        linear programs, not integer programs).
      * A basis is only given for linear programs when solved by the simplex
        method (e.g., not with PDLP).
      * Solvers have widely varying support for returning primal and dual rays.
        E.g. a termination_reason of unbounded does not ensure that a feasible
        solution or a primal ray is returned, check termination_reasons.md for
        solver specific guarantees if this is needed. Further, many solvers will
        provide the ray but not the feasible solution when returning an unbounded
        status.
      * When the termination reason is that a limit was reached or that the result
        is imprecise, a solution may or may not be present. Further, for some
        solvers (generally, convex optimization solvers, not MIP solvers), the
        primal or dual solution may not be feasible.
