// Methods for manipulating LinearExpressions.
//
// Why in labs? Lots of users seem to need this (e.g. for big-M calculations),
// but there are several possible algorithms, and it is not clear what, if
// anything, would be used widely. The function also makes many assumptions on
// the input that are not easy to verify and can lead to confusing errors,
// it is worth seeing if the API can be hardened a bit.

// Computes a lower bound on the value a linear expression can take based on
// the variable bounds.
//
// The user must ensure:
//  * Variable lower bounds are in [-inf, +inf) (required at solve time as well)
//  * Variable upper bounds are in (-inf, +inf] (required at solve time as well)
//  * Variables bounds are not NaN
//  * The expression has no NaNs and all finite coefficients
//  * The output computation does not overflow when summing finite terms (rarely
//    an issue, as then your problem is very poorly scaled).
// Under these assumptions, the returned value will be in [-inf, +inf). If an
// assumption is broken, it is possible to return NaN or +inf.
//
// This function is deterministic, but runs in O(n log n) and will allocate.
//
// Alternatives:
//  * If more precision is needed, see AccurateSum
//  * For a faster method that does not allocate, is less precise, and not
//    deterministic, simply add each term to the result in the hash map's
//    iteration order.
