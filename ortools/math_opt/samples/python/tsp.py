"""Solve the traveling salesperson problem (TSP) with MIP.

In the Euclidean Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), you are given a list of
n cities, each with an (x, y) coordinate, and you must find an order to visit
the cities in to minimize the (Euclidean) travel distance.

The MIP "cutset" formulation for the problem is as follows:
  * Data:
      n: An integer, the number of cities
      (x_i, y_i): a pair of floats for each i in 1..n, the location of each
          city
      d_ij for all (i, j) pairs of cities, the distance between city i and j.
  * Decision variables:
      x_ij: A binary variable, indicates if the edge connecting i and j is
          used. Note that x_ij == x_ji, because the problem is symmetric. We
          only create variables for i < j, and have x_ji as an alias for
          x_ij.
  * MIP model:
      minimize sum_{i=1}^n sum_{j=1, j < i}^n d_ij * x_ij
      s.t. sum_{j=1, j != i}^n x_ij = 2 for all i = 1..n
           sum_{i in S} sum_{j not in S} x_ij >= 2 for all S subset {1,...,n}
                                                   |S| >= 3, |S| <= n - 3
           x_ij in {0, 1}
The first set of constraints are called the degree constraints, and the
second set of constraints are called the cutset constraints. There are
exponentially many cutset, so we cannot add them all at the start of the
solve. Instead, we will use a solver callback to view each integer solution
and add any violated cutset constraints that exist.

Note that, while there are exponentially many cutset constraints, we can
quickly identify violated ones by exploiting that the solution is integer
and the degree constraints are all already in the model and satisfied. As a
result, the graph n nodes and edges when x_ij = 1 will be a degree two graph,
so it will be a collection of cycles. If it is a single large cycle, then the
solution is feasible, and if there multiple cycles, then taking the nodes of
any cycle as S produces a violated cutset constraint.

Note that this is a minimal TSP solution, more sophisticated MIP methods are
possible.
