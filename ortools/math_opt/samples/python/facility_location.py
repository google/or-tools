"""Solves the facility location and processes feasible solutions in a callback.

In the (uncapacitated) facility location problem, we are given a list of
customers, a list of facilities we can open, and a limit on how many of these
facilities we get to open. Each customer must be served from a facility, and
there is a cost to serving this customer from each facility. The goal is to pick
the set of facilities to open that minimizes the cost of serving all customers.

In this example, customers and facilities each have a location on the 2d plane,
and we use Euclidean distance as our cost function.

Two modes are supported. If run with --plot, the solutions are drawn to a GUI
with Matplotlib. Otherwise, the solutions are printed to standard output.
