"""Solve the cutting stock problem by column generation.

The Cutting Stock problem is as follows. You begin with unlimited boards, all
of the same length. You are also given a list of smaller pieces to cut out,
each with a length and a demanded quantity. You want to cut out all these
pieces using as few of your starting boards as possible.

E.g. you begin with boards that are 20 feet long, and you must cut out 3
pieces that are 6 feet long and 5 pieces that are 8 feet long. An optimal
solution is:
  [(6,), (8, 8) (8, 8), (6, 6, 8)]
(We cut a 6 foot piece from the first board, two 8 foot pieces from
the second board, and so on.)

This example approximately solves the problem with a column generation
heuristic. The leader problem is a set cover problem, and the worker is a
knapsack problem. We alternate between solving the LP relaxation of the
leader incrementally, and solving the worker to generate new a configuration
(a column) for the leader. When the worker can no longer find a column
improving the LP cost, we convert the leader problem to a MIP and solve
again. We now give precise statements of the leader and worker.

Problem data:
 * l_i: the length of each piece we need to cut out.
 * d_i: how many copies each piece we need.
 * L: the length of our initial boards.
 * q_ci: for configuration c, the quantity of piece i produced.

Leader problem variables:
 * x_c: how many copies of configuration c to produce.

Leader problem formulation:
  min         sum_c x_c
  s.t. sum_c q_ci * x_c = d_i for all i
                    x_c >= 0, integer for all c.

The worker problem is to generate new configurations for the leader problem
based on the dual variables of the demand constraints in the LP relaxation.
Worker problem data:
  * p_i: The "price" of piece i (dual value from leader's demand constraint)

Worker decision variables:
 * y_i: How many copies of piece i should be in the configuration.

Worker formulation
  max   sum_i p_i * y_i
  s.t.  sum_i l_i * y_i <= L
                    y_i >= 0, integer for all i

An optimal solution y* defines a new configuration c with q_ci = y_i* for all
i. If the solution has objective value <= 1, no further improvement on the LP
is possible. For additional background and proofs see:
  https://people.orie.cornell.edu/shmoys/or630/notes-06/lec16.pdf
or any other reference on the "Cutting Stock Problem".

Note: this problem is equivalent to symmetric bin packing:
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem#Formal_statement
but typically in bin packing it is not assumed that you should exploit having
multiple items of the same size.
