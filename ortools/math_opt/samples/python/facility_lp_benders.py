"""An advanced benders decomposition example.

We consider a network design problem where each location has a demand that
must be met by its neighboring facilities, and each facility can control
its total capacity. In this version we also require that locations cannot
use more that a specified fraction of a facilities capacity.

Problem data:
* F: set of facilities.
* L: set of locations.
* E: subset of {(f,l) : f in F, l in L} that describes the network between
     facilities and locations.
* d: demand at location (all demands are equal for simplicity).
* c: cost per unit of capacity at a facility (all facilities are have the
     same cost for simplicity).
* h: cost per unit transported through an edge.
* a: fraction of a facility's capacity that can be used by each location.

Decision variables:
* z_f: capacity at facility f in F.
* x_(f,l): flow from facility f to location l for all (f,l) in E.

Formulation:

  min c * sum(z_f : f in F) + sum(h_e * x_e : e in E)
  s.t.
                                  x_(f,l) <= a * z_f   for all (f,l) in E
    sum(x_(f,l) : l such that (f,l) in E) <=     z_f   for all f in F
    sum(x_(f,l) : f such that (f,l) in E) >= d     for all l in L
                                      x_e >= 0     for all e in E
                                      z_f >= 0     for all f in F

Below we solve this problem directly and using a benders decompostion
approach.
