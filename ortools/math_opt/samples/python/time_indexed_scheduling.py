"""Solve a time-indexed scheduling problem.

Problem statement:

Schedule jobs sequentially (on a single machine) to minimize the sum of the
completion times, where each job cannot start until its release time. In the
scheduling literature, this problem is 1|r_i|sum_i C_i. This problem is NP-Hard
(e.g. see "Elements of Scheduling" by Lenstra and Shmoys 2020, chapter 4).

Data:
 * n jobs
 * processing time p_i for i = 1,...,n
 * release time r_i for i = 1,...,n
 * Implied: T = max_i r_i + sum_i p_i, the time horizon, all jobs must start
   in [0, T].

Variables:
 * x_it for job i = 1,...,n and time t = 1,...,T, if job i starts at time t.

Model:
  min   sum_i sum_t (t + p_i) * x_it
  s.t.  sum_t x_it = 1                     for all i = 1,...,n     (1)
        sum_i sum_{s=t-p_i+1}^t x_is <= 1  for all t = 0,...,T     (2)
        x_it = 0                           for all i, for t < r_i  (3)
        x_it in {0, 1}                     for all i and t

In the objective, t + p_i is the time the job is completed if it starts at t.
Constraint (1) ensures that each job is scheduled once, constraint (2)
ensures that no two jobs overlap in when they are running, and constraint (3)
enforces the release dates.
