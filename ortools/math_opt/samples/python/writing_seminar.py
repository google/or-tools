"""Solves the problem of assigning students to classes to maximize welfare.

Each student provides a ranking of their top five preferred writing seminars to
be in, and can be assigned to at most one seminar. Each writing seminar has a
capacity of how many students can attend. There is an increasing penalty for
assigning students to their less preferred choice, e.g.

assignment    | penalty
--------------|--------
first choice  | 0
second choice | 1
third choice  | 5
fourth choice | 20
fifth choice  | 100
unassigned    | 1000

(Unassigned can mean either they are in a class they did not choose, or they are
not in any class). The goal is to find a feasible assignment that minimizes the
sum of the penalties over all students.

This method was used as of 2005 at Cornell to assign first year students to
freshman writing seminars.

We model the problem below with MIP, but it is in fact just a min-cost flow
problem. Solving the LP relaxation of this MIP with a simplex based solver
gives integer solutions.

Warning: this method is not strategy proof, students can get a better assignment
by not submitting their true preferences over the seminars.
