// Solver-Callback handling protos:
// Callback functions allow for a fine-grain control, and ongoing interaction
// with the solver during the solve process. The overall architecture is that
// upon solve invocation the user will select what type of interactions to have
// with the solver, and whenever the solver offers an interaction enabled by the
// user, return the statistics collected up to that point, and any additional
// information required by the user. Once done, the callback function must
// return a message to the solver to continue with the solve process.
