# Introduction

This is the documentation page for the Java wrapper of OR-Tools.

This project aim to explain how you build a Java 1.8 native (for win32-x86-64,
linux-x86-64 and darwin-x86-64) maven multiple package using [`mvn`](http://maven.apache.org/)
and few [POM.xml](http://maven.apache.org/pom.html).

## Requirement

You'll need a "Java SDK >= 1.8" and "Maven >= 3.6".

## Directory Layout

* [pom-native.xml.in](pom-native.xml.in) POM template to build the native
  project.
* [com/google/ortools/Loader.java](com/google/ortools/Loader.java) Helper to
  unpack and load the correct native libraries.
* [pom-local.xml.in](pom-local.xml.in) POM template to build the "pure" Java
  project.
* [pom-sample.xml.in](pom-sample.xml.in) POM template used to build samples
  and examples.
* [pom-test.xml.in](pom-test.xml.in) POM template used to build tests.

## Build Process

To Create a native dependent package we will split it in two parts:

* A bunch of `com.google.ortools:ortools-{platform}` maven packages for each
supported platform targeted and containing the native libraries.
* A java maven package `com.google.ortools:ortools-java` depending on the native
package and containing the Java code.

[`platform` names](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna/blob/cc1acdac02e4d0dda93ba01bbe3a3435b8933dab/test/com/sun/jna/PlatformTest.java#L31-L100)
come from the JNA project (Java Native Access) which will be use to find at
runtime on which platform the code is currently running.

### Local Package

The pipeline for `linux-x86-64` should be as follow: \
note: The pipeline will be similar for `darwin-x86-64` and `win32-x86-64`
architecture, don't hesitate to look at the CI log!

#### Building local native Package

Thus we have the C++ shared library `libortools.so` and the SWIG generated JNI
wrappers `libjniortools.so`.

So first let's create the local `com.google.ortools:ortools-{platform}.jar`
maven package.

Here some dev-note concerning this `POM.xml`.
* This package is a native package only containing native libraries.

Then you can generate the package and install it locally using:
```bash
mvn package
mvn install
```
note: this will automatically trigger the `mvn compile` phase.

If everything good the package (located in
`<buildir>/java/ortools-<platform>/target/`) should have this layout:
```
{...}/target/ortools-<platform>-1.0.jar:
\- <platform>
   \-libortools.so.8.0
   \-libjniortools.so
...
```
note: `<platform>` could be `linux-x86-64`, `darwin-x86-64` or `win32-x86-64`.

tips: since maven package are just zip archive you can use `unzip -l <package>.jar`
to study their layout.

#### Building local Package

##### Standard Maven Package

So now, let's create the local `com.google.ortools:ortools-java.jar` maven
package which will depend on our previous native package.

Here some dev-note concerning this `POM.xml`.
* Add runtime dependency on each native package(s) available:
  ```xml
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.google.ortools</groupId>
    <artifactId>ortools-linux-x86-64</artifactId>
    <version>[8.0,)</version>
    <type>jar</type>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
  </dependency>
  ```
  - Add dependency to jna so we can find at runtime the current `<platform>`:
  ```xml
  <dependency>
    <groupId>net.java.dev.jna</groupId>
    <artifactId>jna-platform</artifactId>
    <version>5.5.0</version>
  </dependency>
  ```

Then you can generate the package using:
```bash
mvn package
mvn install
```

If Maven executes these commands successfully, the package (located in
`<buildir>/temp_java/ortools-java/target/`) should have this layout:
```
{...}/target/ortools-java-{build version}.jar:
\- com/
   \- google/
      \- ortools/
         \- Loader$PathConsumer.class
         \- Loader$1.class
         \- Loader.class
         \- constraintsolver/
            \- RoutingModel.class
            \- RoutingIndexManager.class
            \- ...
         \- ...
...
```

##### Dependency-inclusive Maven Package (fat .jar)

We can also create a Maven package that includes all of its own dependencies,
also known as a 'fat .jar'. This is useful for situations in which it is more
convenient, or even necessary, to use a single .jar as a dependency for a Java
OR-Tools project.

One example is when OR-Tools is compiled with third-party solver support (such
as CPLEX or XPress), and one needs to build and execute in an environment that
does not have access to one's local Maven repository (for example, a
remotely-built Docker container).

Building a fat .jar with all dependencies included (including the native
package) allows one to have a single dependency, namely
`com.google.ortools:ortools-java.jar`, which can be marked as
`<scope>provided</scope>` in one's project `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.google.ortools</groupId>
  <artifactId>ortools-java</artifactId>
  <version>{insert build version here}</version>
  <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```
One would then make this fat .jar available in the execution environment's Java
classpath, for example:

```bash
java -cp "/path/to/dependency.jar" -jar "/path/to/your/executable/.jar"
```

There are several ways to make the fat .jar dependency available to your Java
program - please consult [JDK documentation](https://devdocs.io/openjdk/) (this links to
OpenJDK 15 documentation), as well as documentation for any packaging and/or
execution frameworks/tools you may be using.

To package a fat .jar with Maven, run

```bash
mvn package -Dfatjar=true
```
To then (optionally) install it to your local Maven repository, run

```bash
mvn install
```
Note that this will replace any previously downloaded or built 'non-fat-.jar'
ortools-java packages in your local Maven repository

[comment]: <> (FIXME show dependencies within .jar structure)
If Maven executes these commands successfully, the package (located in
`<buildir>/temp_java/ortools-java/target/`) should have this layout:
```
{...}/target/ortools-java-{build version}.jar:
\- com/
   \- google/
      \- ortools/
         \- Loader$PathConsumer.class
         \- Loader$1.class
         \- Loader.class
         \- constraintsolver/
            \- RoutingModel.class
            \- RoutingIndexManager.class
            \- ...
         \- ...
...
```

#### Testing local Package

We can test everything is working by using any sample project.

First you can build it using:
```
cmake --build build
```
note: `ortools-java` which is locally installed in the local maven cache
(`~/.m2/repository/com/google/ortools/ortools-java/...`).

Then you can run it using:
```sh
cmake --build build --target test
```
or manually using:
```
cd <builddir>/java/component/example
mvn compile
mvn exec:java
```
