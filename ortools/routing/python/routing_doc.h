array of structs to help cache, because code that uses such bounds
typically use both bound and cost. - soft bounds are named pairs,
prevents some mistakes. - using operator[] to access elements is not
interesting, because the structure will be accessed through pointers,

Note on the offsets computation: The global/local cumul offsets are
used by the respective optimizers to have smaller numbers, and
therefore better numerical behavior in the LP. These offsets are used
as a minimum value for the cumuls over the route (or globally), i.e. a
value we consider all cumuls to be greater or equal to. When transits
are all positive, the cumuls of every node on a route is necessarily
greater than the cumul of its start. Therefore, the local offset for a
vehicle can be set to the minimum of its start node's cumul, and for
the global optimizers, to the min start cumul over all vehicles.
However, to be able to distinguish between infeasible nodes (i.e.
nodes for which the cumul upper bound is less than the min cumul of
the vehicle's start), we set the offset to "min_start_cumul" - 1. By
doing so, all infeasible nodes described above will have bounds of [0,
0]. Example: Start cumul bounds: [11, 20] --> offset = 11 - 1 = 10.
Two nodes with cumul bounds. Node1: [5, 10], Node2: [7, 20] After
applying the offset to the above windows, they become: Vehicle: [1,
10]. Node1: [0, 0] (infeasible). Node2: [0, 10].

On the other hand, when transits on a route can be negative, no
assumption can be made on the cumuls of nodes wrt the start cumuls,
and the offset is therefore set to 0.)doc";

    R"doc(The following constraint ensures that incompatibilities and
requirements between types are respected.

It verifies both "hard" and "temporal" incompatibilities. Two nodes
with hard incompatible types cannot be served by the same vehicle at
all, while with a temporal incompatibility they can't be on the same
route at the same time. The VisitTypePolicy of a node determines how
visiting it impacts the type count on the route.

For example, for - three temporally incompatible types T1 T2 and T3 -
2 pairs of nodes a1/r1 and a2/r2 of type T1 and T2 respectively, with
- a1 and a2 of VisitTypePolicy TYPE_ADDED_TO_VEHICLE - r1 and r2 of
policy ADDED_TYPE_REMOVED_FROM_VEHICLE - 3 nodes A, UV and AR of type
T3, respectively with type policies TYPE_ADDED_TO_VEHICLE,
TYPE_ON_VEHICLE_UP_TO_VISIT and TYPE_SIMULTANEOUSLY_ADDED_AND_REMOVED
the configurations UV --> a1 --> r1 --> a2 --> r2, a1 --> r1 --> a2
--> r2 --> A and a1 --> r1 --> AR --> a2 --> r2 are acceptable,
whereas the configurations a1 --> a2 --> r1 --> ..., or A --> a1 -->
r1 --> ..., or a1 --> r1 --> UV --> ... are not feasible.

It also verifies same-vehicle and temporal type requirements. A node
of type T_d with a same-vehicle requirement for type T_r needs to be
served by the same vehicle as a node of type T_r. Temporal
requirements, on the other hand, can take effect either when the
dependent type is being added to the route or when it's removed from
it, which is determined by the dependent node's VisitTypePolicy. In
the above example: - If T3 is required on the same vehicle as T1, A,
AR or UV must be on the same vehicle as a1. - If T2 is required when
adding T1, a2 must be visited *before* a1, and if r2 is also visited
on the route, it must be *after* a1, i.e. T2 must be on the vehicle
when a1 is visited: ... --> a2 --> ... --> a1 --> ... --> r2 --> ... -
If T3 is required when removing T1, T3 needs to be on the vehicle when
r1 is visited: ... --> A --> ... --> r1 --> ... OR ... --> r1 --> ...
--> UV --> ...)doc";
