// connected by an edge.

// If the chosen graph type requires a call to `Build()`, the user is expected
// to perform this call, possibly after tweaking the graph.

// Consider using `CompleteGraph` (util/graph/graph.h) instead of this function
// in production code, as it uses constant memory to store the graph. Instead,

// mostly useful for tests or when you have to tweak the graph after creation
// (i.e. a complete graph is just the core of your final graph).
