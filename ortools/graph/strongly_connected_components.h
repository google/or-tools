// This code computes the strongly connected components of a directed graph,
// and presents them sorted by reverse topological order.
//
// It implements an efficient version of Tarjan's strongly connected components
// algorithm published in: Tarjan, R. E. (1972), "Depth-first search and linear
// graph algorithms", SIAM Journal on Computing.
//
// A description can also be found here:
// http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarjan%27s_strongly_connected_components_algorithm
//
// SIMPLE EXAMPLE:
//
// Fill a vector<vector<int>> graph; representing your graph adjacency lists.
// That is, graph[i] contains the nodes adjacent to node #i. The nodes must be
// integers in [0, num_nodes). Then just do:
//
// vector<vector<int>> components;
// FindStronglyConnectedComponents(
//     static_cast<int>(graph.size()), graph, &components);
//
// The nodes of each strongly connected components will be listed in each
// subvector of components. The components appear in reverse topological order:
// outgoing arcs from a component will only be towards earlier components.
//
// IMPORTANT: num_nodes will be the number of nodes of the graph. Its type
// is the type used internally by the algorithm. It is why it is better to
// convert it to int or even int32_t rather than using size_t which takes 64
// bits.

// Finds the strongly connected components of a directed graph. It is templated
// so it can be used in many contexts. See the simple example above for the
// easiest use case.
//
// The requirement of the different types are:
// - The type NodeIndex must be an integer type representing a node of the
//   graph. The nodes must be in [0, num_nodes). It can be unsigned.
// - The type Graph must provide a [] operator such that the following code
//   iterates over the adjacency list of the given node:
//     for (const NodeIndex head : graph[node]) {}
// - The type SccOutput must implement the function:
//     emplace_back(NodeIndex const* begin, NodeIndex const* end);
//   It will be called with the connected components of the given graph as they
//   are found (In the reverse topological order).
//
// More practical details on the algorithm:
// - It deals properly with self-loop and duplicate nodes.
// - It is really fast! and work in O(nodes + edges).
// - Its memory usage is also bounded by O(nodes + edges) but in practice it
//   uses less than the input graph.

// A simple custom output class that just counts the number of SCC. Not
// allocating many vectors can save both space and speed if your graph is large.
