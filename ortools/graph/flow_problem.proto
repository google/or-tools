// Protobuf representing a flow problem on a graph. It supports several problem
// types. Depending on the type, the message is interpreted differently as
// explained under each type description below.
//
// LINEAR_SUM_ASSIGNMENT: the algorithm computes the minimum-cost perfect
// matching if there is one.
//  - Arcs are assumed to be from a left node to a right node. In particular
//    the id space of the left and right nodes can be the same. That is an arc
//    from the left node 0 to the right node 0 will be coded as (0, 0).
//  - If a perfect matching does not exist, the problem is not feasible.
//  - Capacity and supply values are ignored.
//
// MAX_FLOW: The algorithm computes the maximum flow under the arc capacity
// constraints.
//  - Only one source (with supply > 0) and one sink (with supply < 0), the
//    supply values are not important. Only the signs are.
//  - The costs are ignored.
//
// MIN_COST_FLOW: the algorithm computes the flow of minimum cost. If a feasible
// flow does not exist (in particular if the sum of supplies is not 0), the
// problem is not feasible.
