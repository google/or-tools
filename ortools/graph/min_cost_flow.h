// An implementation of a cost-scaling push-relabel algorithm for
// the min-cost flow problem.
//
// In the following, we consider a graph G = (V,E) where V denotes the set
// of nodes (vertices) in the graph, E denotes the set of arcs (edges).
// n = |V| denotes the number of nodes in the graph, and m = |E| denotes the
// number of arcs in the graph.
//
// With each arc (v,w) is associated a nonnegative capacity u(v,w)
// (where 'u' stands for "upper bound") and a unit cost c(v,w). With
// each node v is associated a quantity named supply(v), which
// represents a supply of fluid (if >0) or a demand (if <0).
// Furthermore, no fluid is created in the graph so
//     sum_{v in V} supply(v) = 0.
//
// A flow is a function from E to R such that:
// a) f(v,w) <= u(v,w) for all (v,w) in E (capacity constraint).
// b) f(v,w) = -f(w,v) for all (v,w) in E (flow antisymmetry constraint).
// c) sum on v f(v,w) + supply(w) = 0  (flow conservation).
//
// The cost of a flow is sum on (v,w) in E ( f(v,w) * c(v,w) ) [Note:
// It can be confusing to beginners that the cost is actually double
// the amount that it might seem at first because of flow
// antisymmetry.]
//
// The problem to solve: find a flow of minimum cost such that all the
// fluid flows from the supply nodes to the demand nodes.
//
// The principles behind this algorithm are the following:
//  1/ handle pseudo-flows instead of flows and refine pseudo-flows until an
// epsilon-optimal minimum-cost flow is obtained,
//  2/ deal with epsilon-optimal pseudo-flows.
//
// 1/ A pseudo-flow is like a flow, except that a node's outflow minus
// its inflow can be different from its supply. If it is the case at a
// given node v, it is said that there is an excess (or deficit) at
// node v. A deficit is denoted by a negative excess and inflow =
// outflow + excess.
// (Look at ortools/graph/max_flow.h to see that the definition
// of preflow is more restrictive than the one for pseudo-flow in that a preflow
// only allows non-negative excesses, i.e., no deficit.)
// More formally, a pseudo-flow is a function f such that:
// a) f(v,w) <= u(v,w) for all (v,w) in E  (capacity constraint).
// b) f(v,w) = -f(w,v) for all (v,w) in E (flow antisymmetry constraint).
//
// For each v in E, we also define the excess at node v, the algebraic sum of
// all the incoming preflows at this node, added together with the supply at v.
//    excess(v) = sum on u f(u,v) + supply(v)
//
// The goal of the algorithm is to obtain excess(v) = 0 for all v in V, while
// consuming capacity on some arcs, at the lowest possible cost.
//
// 2/ Internally to the algorithm and its analysis (but invisibly to
// the client), each node has an associated "price" (or potential), in
// addition to its excess. It is formally a function from E to R (the
// set of real numbers.). For a given price function p, the reduced
// cost of an arc (v,w) is:
//    c_p(v,w) = c(v,w) + p(v) - p(w)
// (c(v,w) is the cost of arc (v,w).) For those familiar with linear
// programming, the price function can be viewed as a set of dual
// variables.
//
// For a constant epsilon >= 0, a pseudo-flow f is said to be epsilon-optimal
// with respect to a price function p if for every residual arc (v,w) in E,
//    c_p(v,w) >= -epsilon.
//
// A flow f is optimal if and only if there exists a price function p such that
// no arc is admissible with respect to f and p.
//
// If the arc costs are integers, and epsilon < 1/n, any epsilon-optimal flow
// is optimal. The integer cost case is handled by multiplying all the arc costs
// and the initial value of epsilon by (n+1). When epsilon reaches 1, and
// the solution is epsilon-optimal, it means: for all residual arc (v,w) in E,
//    (n+1) * c_p(v,w) >= -1, thus c_p(v,w) >= -1/(n+1) >= 1/n, and the
// solution is optimal.
//
// A node v is said to be *active* if excess(v) > 0.
// In this case the following operations can be applied to it:
// - if there are *admissible* incident arcs, i.e. arcs which are not saturated,
//   and whose reduced costs are negative, a PushFlow operation can
//   be applied. It consists in sending as  much flow as both the excess at the
//   node and the capacity of the arc permit.
// - if there are no admissible arcs, the active node considered is relabeled,
// This is implemented in Discharge, which itself calls PushFlow and Relabel.
//
// Discharge itself is called by Refine. Refine first saturates all the
// admissible arcs, then builds a stack of active nodes. It then applies
// Discharge for each active node, possibly adding new ones in the process,
// until no nodes are active. In that case an epsilon-optimal flow is obtained.
//
// Optimize iteratively calls Refine, while epsilon > 1, and divides epsilon by
// alpha (set by default to 5) before each iteration.
//
// The algorithm starts with epsilon = C, where C is the maximum absolute value
// of the arc costs. In the integer case which we are dealing with, since all
// costs are multiplied by (n+1), the initial value of epsilon is (n+1)*C.
// The algorithm terminates when epsilon = 1, and Refine() has been called.
// In this case, a minimum-cost flow is obtained.
//
// The complexity of the algorithm is O(n^2*m*log(n*C)) where C is the value of
// the largest arc cost in the graph.
//
// IMPORTANT:
// The algorithm is not able to detect the infeasibility of a problem (i.e.,
// when a bottleneck in the network prohibits sending all the supplies.)
// Worse, it could in some cases loop forever. This is why feasibility checking
// is enabled by default (FLAGS_min_cost_flow_check_feasibility=true.)
// Feasibility checking is implemented using a max-flow, which has a much lower
// complexity. The impact on performance is negligible, while the risk of being
// caught in an endless loop is removed. Note that using the feasibility checker
// roughly doubles the memory consumption.
