// Given a directed graph, as defined by the arc list "arcs", computes either:
//   1. If the graph is acyclic, the matrix of values x, where x[i][j] indicates
//      that there is a directed path from i to j.
//   2. If the graph is cyclic, "error_cycle_out" is set to contain the cycle,
//      and the return value is empty.
//
// The algorithm runs in O(num_nodes^2 + num_nodes*num_arcs).
//
// Inputs:
//   arcs: each a in "arcs" is a directed edge from a.first to a.second.  Must
//         have a.first, a.second >= 0.  The graph is assumed to have nodes
//         {0,1,...,max_{a in arcs} max(a.first, a.second)}, or have no nodes
//         if arcs is the empty list.
//   error_was_cyclic: output arg, is set to true if a cycle is detected.
//   error_cycle_out: output arg, if a cycle is detected, error_cycle_out is
//                    set to contain the nodes of the cycle in order.
//
// Note: useful for computing the transitive closure of a binary relation, e.g.
// given the relation i < j for i,j in S that is transitive and some known
// values i < j, create a node for each i in S and an arc for each known
// relationship.  Then any relationship implied by transitivity is given by
// the resulting matrix produced, or if the relation fails transitivity, a cycle
// proving this is produced.
