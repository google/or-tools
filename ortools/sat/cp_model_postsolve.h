// Postsolves the given response using information filled by our presolver.
//
// This works as follow:
// - First we fix fixed variables of the mapping_model according to the solution
//   of the presolved problem and the index mapping.
// - Then, we process the mapping constraints in "reverse" order, and unit
//   propagate each of them when necessary. By construction this should never
//   give rise to any conflicts. And after each constraints, we should have
//   a feasible solution to the presolved problem + all already postsolved
//   constraints. This is the invariant we maintain.
// - Finally, we arbitrarily fix any free variables left and update the given
//   response with the new solution.
//
// Note: Most of the postsolve operations require the constraints to have been
// written in the correct way by the presolve.
//
// TODO(user): We could use the search strategy to fix free variables to some
// chosen values? The feature might never be needed though.
