  // - Fix some Boolean variables (if we reach a conflict while probing).
  //
  // - Infer new direct implications. We add them directly to the
  //   BinaryImplicationGraph and they can later be used to detect equivalent
  //   literals, expand at most ones clique, etc...
  //
  // - Tighten the bounds of integer variables. If we probe the two possible
  //   values of a Boolean (b=0 and b=1), we get for each integer variables two
  //   propagated domain D_0 and D_1. The level zero domain can then be
  //   intersected with D_0 U D_1. This can restrict the lower/upper bounds of a
  //   variable, but it can also create holes in the domain! This will detect

// we detect that x => not(x) via propagation after taking x as a decision. It
