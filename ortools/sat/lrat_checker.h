  //    stops at the first empty clause). This list must be in unit propagation
  //    order: if a clause c becomes unit (or empty) because clauses c_1, ...,
  //    c_k are unit, then c must appear after c_1, ..., c_k in the list. Let
  //    RUP be all the literals which are found to be false by unit propagation.
  // 3) If `rat` is empty, the last `unit_ids` clause must become empty after
  //    unit propagation.

  //    all the current clauses which contain the negation of the first
  //    literal of `clause` (called the pivot 'p') -- and no other clauses.
  //    Moreover, for each r in `rat`:
  //    * Either `clause` and the `r.resolvant_id` clause have two pairs of
  //      complementary literals.
  //    * Or all the `r.unit_ids` clauses must become unit and eventually empty
  //      if all the literals of `clause` and of the `r.resolvant_id` clause
  //      (minus ~p), as well as those in RUP (from condition 2), are assumed to
