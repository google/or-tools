    """This method uses a circuit constraint to rank tasks.

    This method assumes that all starts are disjoint, meaning that all tasks have
    a strictly positive duration, and they appear in the same NoOverlap
    constraint.

    The extra node (with id 0) will be used to decide which task is first with
    its only outgoing arc, and which task is last with its only incoming arc.
    Each task i will be associated with id i + 1, and an arc between i + 1 and j +
    1 indicates that j is the immediate successor of i.

    The circuit constraint ensures there is at most 1 hamiltonian cycle of
    length > 1. If no such path exists, then no tasks are active.
    We also need to enforce that any hamiltonian cycle of size > 1 must contain
    the node 0. And thus, there is a self loop on node 0 iff the circuit is empty.

    Args:
      model: The CpModel to add the constraints to.
      starts: The array of starts variables of all tasks.
      durations: the durations of all tasks.
      presences: The array of presence variables of all tasks.
      penalties: the array of tuple (`tail_index`, `head_index`, `penalty`) that
        specifies that if task `tail_index` is the successor of the task
        `head_index`, then `penalty` must be added to the cost.
      delays: the array of tuple (`tail_index`, `head_index`, `delay`) that
        specifies that if task `tail_index` is the successor of the task
        `head_index`, then an extra `delay` must be added between the end of the
        first task and the start of the second task.

    Returns:
      The list of pairs (Boolean variables, penalty) to be added to the objective.
