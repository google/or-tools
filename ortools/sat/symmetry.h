// Devriendt J., Bogaerts B., De Cat B., Denecker M., Mears C. "Symmetry
// propagation: Improved Dynamic Symmetry Breaking in SAT", 2012,
// IEEE 24th International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence.
//
// Basically, each time a literal is propagated, this class tries to detect
// if another literal could also be propagated by symmetry. Note that this uses
// a heuristic in order to be efficient and that it is not exhaustive in the
// sense that it doesn't detect all possible propagations.
//
// Algorithm details:
//
// Given the current solver trail (i.e. the assigned literals and their
// assignment order) the idea is to compute (as efficiently as possible) for
// each permutation added to this class what is called the first (under the
// trail assignment order) non-symmetric literal. A literal 'l' is said to be
// non-symmetric under a given assignment and for a given permutation 'p' if
// 'l' is assigned to true but not 'p(l)'.
//
// If a first non-symmetric literal 'l' for a permutation 'p' is not a decision,
// then:
// - Because it is not a decision, 'l' has been implied by a reason formed by
//   literals assigned to true at lower trail indices.
// - Because this is the first non-symmetric literal for 'p', the permuted
//   reason only contains literal that are also assigned to true.
// - Because of this, 'p(l)' is also implied by the current assignment.
//   Of course, this assume that p is a symmetry of the full problem.
//   Note that if it is already assigned to false, then we have a conflict.
//
// TODO(user): Implement the optimizations mentioned in the paper?
// TODO(user): Instrument and see if the code can be optimized.
