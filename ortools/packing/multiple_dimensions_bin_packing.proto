// A Multiple Dimension BinPacking problem.
// It supports the following file format:
//  - 2bp:
//    see http://or.dei.unibo.it/library/two-dimensional-bin-packing-problem
//
// The generated problems have the following characteristics:
//
// You have identical boxes with n dimensions. The size of one box is stored in
// the field box_shape().
// You need to fit all items into the minimum number of boxes. Each item has the
// same number of dimensions and one or more possible shapes (this usually means
// that you can rotate the item).
// Each item must not overlap (in n dimensions) with any other item.

// The shape of one item. each edge is parallel to one axis of a dimension.
// One shape cannot be rotated, the item itself will contain multiple rotated
// shapes.
