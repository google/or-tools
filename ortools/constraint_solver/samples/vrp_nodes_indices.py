"""Sample to better understand Node/Index relation.

This script generate few markdown tables to better understand
the relation between nodes and indices.

Things to notice:
* Since we have two duplicates (node 5 and node 4) solver need 2 extra indices to have an unique index for each vehicle start/stop and locations.
* Solver needs to "create" an index for a vehicle 1 start since solver need an unique start index per vehicle.
* All end nodes are moved to the end of the index list aka [15, 16, 17, 18].
* routing.Size() return the number of node which are not end nodes (here 15 aka [0-14])
note: using the two properties above, we know that any index in range(routing.Size()) is not a vehicle end node.

* Since end nodes are moved to the end, their respective "empty" node index are
reused so all locations indices are "shifted"
e.g. node 9 is mapped to index 6
* Same for start nodes which are moved to "empty" space
e.g. start node 7 mapped to index 4

Takeaway:
* Allways use routing.Start(), routing.End(), manager.IndexToNode() or manager.NodeToIndex().
* Location node is not necessarily equal to its index.
* To loop through ALL indices use manager.GetNumberOfIndices() (Python) or manager::num_indices() (C++)
