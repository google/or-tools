 * A C++ wrapper that provides a simple and unified interface to
 * several linear programming and mixed integer programming solvers:
 * GLOP, GLPK, CLP, CBC, and SCIP. The wrapper can also be used in Java, C#,
 * and Python via SWIG.
 *
 * What is Linear Programming?
 *
 *   In mathematics, linear programming (LP) is a technique for optimization of
 *   a linear objective function, subject to linear equality and linear
 *   inequality constraints. Informally, linear programming determines the way
 *   to achieve the best outcome (such as maximum profit or lowest cost) in a
 *   given mathematical model and given some list of requirements represented
 *   as linear equations.
 *
 *   The most widely used technique for solving a linear program is the Simplex
 *   algorithm, devised by George Dantzig in 1947. It performs very well on
 *   most instances, for which its running time is polynomial. A lot of effort
 *   has been put into improving the algorithm and its implementation. As a
 *   byproduct, it has however been shown that one can always construct
 *   problems that take exponential time for the Simplex algorithm to solve.
 *   Research has thus focused on trying to find a polynomial algorithm for
 *   linear programming, or to prove that linear programming is indeed
 *   polynomial.
 *
 *   Leonid Khachiyan first exhibited in 1979 a weakly polynomial algorithm for
 *   linear programming. "Weakly polynomial" means that the running time of the
 *   algorithm is in O(P(n) * 2^p) where P(n) is a polynomial of the size of the
 *   problem, and p is the precision of computations expressed in number of
 *   bits. With a fixed-precision, floating-point-based implementation, a weakly
 *   polynomial algorithm will  thus run in polynomial time. No implementation
 *   of Khachiyan's algorithm has proved efficient, but a larger breakthrough in
 *   the field came in 1984 when Narendra Karmarkar introduced a new interior
 *   point method for solving linear programming problems. Interior point
 *   algorithms have proved efficient on very large linear programs.
 *
 *   Check Wikipedia for more detail:
 *     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming
 *
 * -----------------------------------
 *
 * Example of a Linear Program
 *
 *   maximize:
 *     3x + y
 *   subject to:
 *     1.5 x + 2 y <= 12
 *     0 <= x <= 3
 *     0 <= y <= 5
 *
 *  A linear program has:
 *    1) a linear objective function
 *    2) linear constraints that can be equalities or inequalities
 *    3) bounds on variables that can be positive, negative, finite or
 *       infinite.
 *
 * -----------------------------------
 *
 * What is Mixed Integer Programming?
 *
 *   Here, the constraints and the objective are still linear but
 *   there are additional integrality requirements for variables. If
 *   all variables are required to take integer values, then the
 *   problem is called an integer program (IP). In most cases, only
 *   some variables are required to be integer and the rest of the
 *   variables are continuous: this is called a mixed integer program
 *   (MIP). IPs and MIPs are generally NP-hard.
 *
 *   Integer variables can be used to model discrete decisions (build a
 *   datacenter in city A or city B), logical relationships (only
 *   place machines in datacenter A if we have decided to build
 *   datacenter A) and approximate non-linear functions with piecewise
 *   linear functions (for example, the cost of machines as a function
 *   of how many machines are bought, or the latency of a server as a
 *   function of its load).
 *
 * -----------------------------------
 *
 * How to use the wrapper
 *
 *   The user builds the model and solves it through the MPSolver class,
 *   then queries the solution through the MPSolver, MPVariable and
 *   MPConstraint classes. To be able to query a solution, you need the
 *   following:
 *   - A solution exists: MPSolver::Solve has been called and a solution
 *     has been found.
 *   - The model has not been modified since the last time
 *     MPSolver::Solve was called. Otherwise, the solution obtained
 *     before the model modification may not longer be feasible or
 *     optimal.
 *
 * @see ../examples/linear_programming.cc for a simple LP example.
 *
 * @see ../examples/integer_programming.cc for a simple MIP example.
 *
 *   All methods cannot be called successfully in all cases. For
 *   example: you cannot query a solution when no solution exists, you
 *   cannot query a reduced cost value (which makes sense only on
 *   continuous problems) on a discrete problem. When a method is
 *   called in an unsuitable context, it aborts with a
 *   LOG(FATAL).
 * TODO(user): handle failures gracefully.
 *
 * -----------------------------------
 *
 * For developers: How the wrapper works
 *
 *   MPSolver stores a representation of the model (variables,
 *   constraints and objective) in its own data structures and a
 *   pointer to a MPSolverInterface that wraps the underlying solver
 *   (GLOP, CBC, CLP, GLPK, or SCIP) that does the actual work. The
 *   underlying solver also keeps a representation of the model in its
 *   own data structures. The model representations in MPSolver and in
 *   the underlying solver are kept in sync by the 'extraction'
 *   mechanism: synchronously for some changes and asynchronously
 *   (when MPSolver::Solve is called) for others. Synchronicity
 *   depends on the modification applied and on the underlying solver.
