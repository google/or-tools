// For each pair of locations, a `distance` is specified and for each pair of
// facilities a `weight` is specified (e.g., the amount of supplies transported
// between the two facilities). The problem is to assign all facilities to
// different locations with the goal of minimizing the sum of the distances
// multiplied by the corresponding flows.

// Reads a QAP problem from file in a format used in QAPLIB. See

// n is the number of factories/locations, and W and D are weight and
// distance matrices, respectively. Both W and D are square matrices of size
// N x N. Each entry of the matrices must parse as double (we CHECK if it
// does). Multiple spaces, or '\n' are disregarded. For example:
//
// 2
//
// 0 2
// 3 0
//
// 0 2
// 1 0
//
// defines a problem with two factories and two locations. There are 2 units of
// supply flowing from factory 0 to factory 1, and 3 units of supply flowing
// from factory 1 to 0. The distance from location 0 to location 1 is equal
// to 2, and the distance from location 1 to 0 is equal to 1.
