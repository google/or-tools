// Classes for permuting indexable, ordered containers of data without
// depending on that data to be accessible in any particular way. The
// client needs to give us two things:
//   1. a permutation to apply to some container(s) of data, and
//   2. a description of how to move data around in the container(s).
//
// The permutation (1) comes to us in the form of an array argument to
// PermutationApplier::Apply(), along with index values that tell us
// where in that array the permutation of interest lies. Typically
// those index values will span the entire array that describes the
// permutation.
//
// Applying a permutation involves decomposing the permutation into
// disjoint cycles and walking each element of the underlying data one
// step around the unique cycle in which it participates. The
// decomposition into disjoint cycles is done implicitly on the fly as
// the code in PermutationApplier::Apply() advances through the array
// describing the permutation. As an important piece of bookkeeping to
// support the decomposition into cycles, the elements of the
// permutation array typically get modified somehow to indicate which
// ones have already been used.
//
// At first glance, it would seem that if the containers are
// indexable, we don't need anything more complicated than just the
// permutation and the container of data we want to permute; it would
// seem we can just use the container's operator[] to retrieve and
// assign elements within the container. Unfortunately it's not so
// simple because the containers of interest can be indexable without
// providing any consistent way of accessing their contents that
// applies to all the containers of interest. For instance, if we
// could insist that every indexable container must define a
// `value_type& operator[]` we could simply use that for the assignments we need
// to do while walking around cycles of the permutation. This is not guaranteed
// though (common examples are `std::vector<bool>` or containers of bit-sized
// integers for which no c++ reference exists).
// This is the main reason we need a codified description (2) of
// how to move data around in the indexable container. That
// description comes to us via the PermutationApplier constructor's
// argument which is a PermutationCycleHandler instance. Such an
// object has three important methods defined: SetTempFromIndex(),
// SetIndexFromIndex(), and SetIndexFromTemp(). Those methods embody
// all we need to know about how to move data in the indexable
// container(s) underlying the PermutationCycleHandler.
//
// Another reason we need the description (2) of how to move elements
// around in the container(s) is that it is often important to permute
// side-by-side containers of elements according to the same
// permutation. This situation, too, is covered by defining a
// PermutationCycleHandler that knows about multiple underlying
// indexable containers.
//
// The above-mentioned PermutationCycleHandler methods embody
// knowledge of how to assign elements. It happens that
// PermutationCycleHandler is also a convenient place to embody the
// knowledge of how to keep track of which permutation elements have
// been consumed by the process of walking data around cycles. We
// depend on the PermutationCycleHandler instance we're given to
// define SetSeen() and Unseen() methods for that purpose.
//
// For the common case in which elements can be accessed using
// operator[](), we provide the class template
// ArrayIndexCycleHandler.
