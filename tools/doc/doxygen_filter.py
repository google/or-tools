"""Doxygen pre-filter script for ion.

This filter processes code and adds Doxygen-compatible markup in various places
to enable Doxygen to read the docs more fully.  Unlike some other Doxygen
filters, it is designed to work with Doxygen's newer markdown syntax.

In order to ensure proper syntax coloring of indented code blocks, make sure
there is a blank (commented) line both above and below the block.  For example:

// Comment comment comment.
//
//     int CodeBlock() {
//       Goes here;
//     }
//
// More comment.

    highlighting is applied.  Any block surrounded by "~~~" on both sides is
    also treated as code, but these are syntax highlighted intelligently
    depending on the file type.  We typically write code blocks in the former
    style, but we'd like them to be highlighted, so this function converts them
    to the latter style by adding in the ~~~ lines.

    To make this a bit more complicated, we would really prefer not to insert
    new lines into the file, since that will make the line numbers shown in
    doxygen not match the line numbers in the actual source code.  For this
    reason, we only perform the conversion if at least one "blank" line (empty
    comment line) appears before the start of the code block.  If we get down to
    the bottom of the block and there's no blank line after it, we will be
    forced to add a line, since we can't go back and undo what we already did.
